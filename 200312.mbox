Sorry if I missed this, but did the Corporate CLA already move=20
beyond draft to final?  I had seen it [0] linked from the proposed=20
licenses page [1] (note the big disclaimer at the top), but now=20
there appears to be a final version [2] (without the disclaimer)
linked from the main licenses page [3].

I suspect you inadvertantly posted this to the right place.  :)

"license@apache.org" was set up to discuss the Apache 2.0 license and the
other proposed docs associated with it.  "licensing@apache.org" was the
more free-form list for discussion Apache licensing issues in general
(including donation forms, etc).  Anyways, the document at

  http://apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt

is older than the one we used with BEA, and I'm not sure it's been used
with any company.  The document at

  http://apache.org/licenses/proposed/cla-corporate.txt

is the newer one used with BEA, and slightly modified to make it
consistant with the language in the Apache 2.0 license.  Though it should
also work for us today, if there are other companies looking for a similar
sort of document.

They have both been up there ever since I moved all of the licenses
to those directories.  The one under proposed is different from the
one that was approved and signed (the one in licenses).

I remember that the following issues were raised:

* License for the license is insufficiently permissive.
Thread starting: 
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=license@apache.org&msgNo=38
Everyone agreed that there was a better way to write what was intended, 
so this should be uncontroversial.

* Clause 3C is overbroad, apparently by accident.
Everyone seemed to agree that it should be narrowed; Eben Moglen wrote a 
good fix in his message:
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=license@apache.org&msgNo=69

* NOTICE clause is written unclearly, and may be overbroad as written, 
although the intention is correct.  Most notably, it doesn't allow the 
removal of notices which *never* applied to the work in question.  It 
also never defines 'notices'; it should specify that these are supposed 
to be legal notices.  (Among other threads, mine at 
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=license@apache.org&msgId=1125924.)

* Clause 5 sentence one is considered overbroad and dangerous by many 
including HP, the FSF, and Debian -- insofar as it may impact entirely 
unrelated patent lawsuits having nothing to do with the work in 
question, even for patents having little to do with software but 
theoretically "applicable to software".  (Although I guess a few people 
supported it.)  In contrast, Clause 5 sentence 2 is supported and 
approved by everyone.  (And some people felt that it should be broadened 
to terminate copyright licenses as well, although that would render it 
GPL-incompatible.)

I might have missed some, but I don't think so. :-)

So I guess someone should be working up a second draft.  But the first 
draft is still the one on the webpage.  Is there an estimated time for a 
second draft to come out for commentary?  (January? March? June?)  Just 
so we know when to start thinking about it again.

IANAL but I do wonder if Clause 7 ("Redistribution with Modification") 
could state more clearly that both source and binary-only Derivative 
Works are permitted.

In addition shouldn't 7(c) -- "You must cause any modified files to 
carry prominent notices..." be more along the lines of "You must cause 
the source code of any modified files to carry prominent notices..."? 
Otherwise would one not have to somehow include a prominent notice in 
every modified binary?

Regards,

Dave

Yesterday, or at least that was the idea before the power failed.
I'll send it in a minute.  Since the changes were extensive, they
required internal review first.

It should be clearer in the updated version I just posted.

Yes, if the binary was modified. In general, though, the source is
modified and the binary is simply replaced, in which case the compiler
will note that automatically.

Thank you all for your comments on the proposed license.  I have
incorporated as much of the changes as possible and posted a new
version on the site

     http://www.apache.org/licenses/proposed/

Note that I have only updated the proposed 2.0 and Individual CLA
licenses so far -- the others will have to wait until I find some
time during the holidays.  I include the current revision (1.23)
below for your convenience.

Cheers,

Roy T. Fielding, co-founder, The Apache Software Foundation

       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or =20
Object
       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which =20=

the
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other =20
modifications
       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the =20=

purposes
       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that =20=

remain
       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the =20
interfaces of,
       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

       "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, =20
including
       the original version of the Work and any modifications or =20

behalf of
       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, =20

systems,
       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, =20=

Contribution."

       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal =20
Entity
       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor =
and
       subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions =
of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute =
the
       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have =20=

made,
       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the =
Work,
       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
       meet the following conditions:

       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files; and

       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and

       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute =20=

must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file =
distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; =20=

or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The =20
contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, =
alongside
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
           as modifying the License.

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications =
and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies =
with
       the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state =20
otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the =
Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or =20
modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions. You should not submit
       as a "Contribution" any work that is not Your original creation.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the =20
trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the =20
Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing =
=20
the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE =
file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or =20
conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining =
the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume =
any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this =20
License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, =20
special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as =
a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by =20
reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
