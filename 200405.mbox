Hello,

The following URIs still point to the version 1.1 licence:

   * http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt

   * http://www.apache.org/LICENSE

   * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE.txt

   * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE

There are quite a lot of places (<http://httpd.apache.org/> as well as 
external sites) pointing to these URIs, wrongly implying that ASL 1.1 is 
the current Apache licence.  Perhaps they could point to the new licence 
instead?

Regards,

Dave

I've fixed the first two by redirecting them to the /licenses/ directory.
The second two are needed as a historical document.  The only links that
should refer to them are historical.  Any others should be fixed.  (If
people think there will be lots of confusion, I could rename that file
LICENSE-1.0 and redirect the old links to the /licenses/ directory.  But I
don't think it is necessary.)

I have also fixed all the links I found on httpd.apache.org (although
there may be some more in the docs that I haven't checked).

Thanks for the note.

Joshua.
