I'd like to suggest that the first section of the license contain a 
complete set of terms and definitions for the rest of the document.  
Some of these are already present ("License" "You," and so forth), but 
the ones that aren't seems most important -- "Work" and "Derivative 
work."

The first time "derivative works" appears is in 4.(a) and it is not 
defined;  it appears again in 4(b) chained to Work ("the Work and 
derivative works thereof"), but these terms are also not defined.

Then, in section 7, we get what looks like a definition of Derivative 
work, but I'm not sure that it extends to the earlier sections.

It also wasn't clear to me whether compiled object code of unmodified 
source counts as a derivative work or not.  Section 4 implies that it 
might be, but the definition in section 7 stipulates that you have 
modify the source to create a derivative work.  So, I'm not clear on 
what this license says about non-source distribution.

The Apache Software Foundation is considering the adoption of a
new set of licenses for our open source projects.  We invite you to
review and comment on the proposed 2.0 license and related material,
which can be found at

     http://www.apache.org/licenses/proposed/

A mailing list has been set up for public review and discussion
of the license prior to the ASF members meeting at ApacheCon [*].
The address is <license AT apache.org> and you can join it by
sending a blank message to <license-subscribe AT apache.org>.

The goals of this license revision have been to reduce the number
of frequently asked questions, to allow the license to be reusable
without modification by any project (including non-ASF projects),
to allow the license to be included by reference instead of listed
in every file, to clarify the license on submission of contributions,
to require a patent license on contributions that necessarily
infringe the contributor's own patents, and to move comments
regarding specific Apache trademarks and attribution notices to
a location outside the license terms (the NOTICE file).

The result should be a license that is compatible with other
open source licenses, such as the GPL, and yet still remains true
to the original goals of the Apache Group and supportive of
collaborative development across both nonprofit and commercial
organizations.  At least that's the idea -- if you note a potential
problem with the new license, please let us know so that we can
work on fixing it now rather than after it has been applied to
our projects.

A few comments on the proposed license.

First, some background.  I've read many open-source licenses carefully, and 
am reasonably facile with contracts, especially software license 
agreements.  The current crop of open-source licenses range in readability 
from great to awful.  No matter how reasonable the license terms are, if 
the license is hard to understand without spending 15 minutes reading it 
carefully, its not going to be effective.

My first reaction to the new ASL license is "The Second System Effect."  I 
think you did a good job at addressing goals 2-8, to the serious detriment 
of goals 1 and 9.

I think there are two reasons the ASL license is one of the most 
widely-used open-source licenses -- it is clear, and it is reasonable.  In 
reading the new draft, the same reasonability comes through, but I think 
some clarity is lost.

Now, perhaps I'm being naive, but I think that an open-source license 
should be clearly understandable by non-lawyers.  ASL 1.0 was.  (MPL was 
not.)  I think the proposed ASL 2.0 has taken a big step away from clarity 
in the interests of comprehensiveness.  Perhaps both goals can be realized.

To wit:

>  * Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
>  * modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions
>  * are met:

I just love this.  You get right to the punchline straight away.  This is 
what makes the ASL a great license.

Eric Friedman suggested this:

>I'd like to suggest that the first section of the license contain a 
>complete set of terms and definitions for the rest of the document.

I think this is exactly the opposite of what we want.  While this is a 
contract, there's a strong desire to make it NOT read like one.  (Its not a 
program, either.)

There's no reason you have to define "You" before you use the term 
"You."  Most people will know what it means.  Those who don't can read the 
definition in the footnote.  This is not an arcane contract.  Things like 
"You", "Contributor", "Source Code", and the like are likely to be 
understood well enough by the reader.  Don't make them wade through those 
definitions before they can get to the meat.

Here's an approach we take in our contracts.  The contract body is a 
one-page document that describes business terms -- what, when, who, how 
much (including things like scope of license grant.)  The legal terms are 
all described in a multi-page terms-and-conditions attachment.  The body 
may refer to things defined in the T&C (e.g., "source code"), but if you 
are comfortable that you know what source code is, you don't have to wade 
through the definition.

Perhaps this approach would work well for ASL -- have the first half be 
plain-language descriptions of the rights and obligations, and refer to 
definitions that occur later in the document.  People can then start at the 
beginning and stop when they feel they "get it", which might not require 
reading the whole thing.

Everyone knows ASL is an open-source license.  When confronted with an 
open-source license, a businessperson wants to know "how open is it 
really?"  We should strive to answer those questions in the first few 
paragraphs.  Again, take the MPL.  Were I a typical businessperson, 
confronted with a package of technology licensed under MPL, I would keep 
looking, not because MPL is an unreasonable license, but because I can't 
understand it.

Now, to the draft.  My goal here is to suggest things that can be (a) cut, 
or (b) moved down in the license.

>             Copyright (C) 2003  The Apache Software Foundation.
>          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
>          of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Does a license agreement need a license agreement?

>                             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
>            FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION
>
>    1. Licensing the Work. These terms and conditions for use,
>       reproduction, distribution, and modification (the "License") apply
>       to any original work of authorship (the "Work") containing a

As far as I can tell, this says nothing.  Its kind of like "the party of 
the first part shall heretofore be known as the party of the first 
part."  Any work that has a notice that incorporates by reference the ASL 
meets the need to define the work and the license.  If you have to say 
this, make this the last paragraph, not the first.

>    2. You. "You" or "Your" means an individual or legal entity
>       exercising permissions granted by this License.

Such definitions are probably better made in a footnote.  I'm three 
paragraphs in and I still don't know what any of my rights are!

>By exercising any
>       of the permissions granted to You in Sections 4 through 8 herein,
>       You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms
>       and conditions.

By signing this contract, the parties hereby agree to abide by the 
contract.  Redundant.  Again, why does this precede the statement of rights?

>    3. Contributors and Contributions.

Again, defining Contributor and Contribution, while essential, could be 
done in a footnote.  Bring on the meat!

>    4. Contributor Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions
>       of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You:
>

>           submitted by the Contributor.

Ah, meat.  This should be the FIRST thing in the license.  There's no legal 
reason why a term, especially an obvious one like You, has to be defined 
before its first use.

>       No assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Work does

Entirely reasonable.  Perhaps moving 4 and 5 to section labeled "Patents" 
would help those who don't care about patents not have to read it.

Mmm, more meat.  Move this higher.

           The contents of the NOTICE file are for

I'm not sure that this is legally viable, unless I misread the intent.  The 
NOTICE file contains the statement of license, incorporating by reference 
these terms and conditions.  The terms and conditions which are 
incorporated by reference can't then place a limitation on the validity of 
the NOTICE file as a license instrument which incorporates the terms.

>       (c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
>           stating that You changed the files.

This is a pretty strong requirement.  Every change must be commented, or I 
am in breach?  Is this really what you want to say?

>    8. Redistribution with Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and
>       to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity, or liability

Appears to be inconsistent with the thing about the NOTICES file above.  If 
I can redistribute with additional terms, wouldn't the NOTICES file be the 
place to say this?

OK, now to the goals.

I think significant clarity has been lost, not because the license is not 
more clear than the previous iteration, but the level of effort required to 
extract the information of what the license really says has gone up by an 
order of magnitude.  I'm confident that I understood the original ASL after 
three minutes without legal consultation; this one will take many times 
that time, and still I would want to consult a lawyer to make sure I 
understand it.

Good.

I think it can be made quite a bit shorter and clearer without compromising 
your goals.

The Work is defined in section 1.

Hmm, indeed this is confusing -- it stems from a recent change from
"Derived Work" to "Derivative Work".  A "derivative work" is defined
in US copyright law, but I am not sure about the laws of other 
countries.
That confusion is probably why the GPL uses "Derived Work".

Yes, that is a derivative work, and we need to be more clear about that
if it isn't obvious from the text as is.

Both the 2.0 and MPL licenses attempt to deal with the issue of 
accepting
contributions rather than simply licensing the right to copy.  As such,
we don't want a person to "read a few paragraphs" and come away thinking
they understand the whole license -- they don't.

We like it too.  However, it also makes it somewhat difficult to apply
to documentation, and people are constantly asking us what it means in
terms of commercial use, open versus closed source, etc.  It also 
doesn't
allow for licensing by reference, which is why we define Work.
As such, it doesn't work well for us as developers.

It can be argued (and has been, successfully) that such a contract can
only be valid if the buyer's understanding of those terms already
matches that of the seller, since you are effectively telling the buyer
that they don't need to understand the terms in order to understand
and agree to the contract.  The terms we define aren't that numerous
and are defined in context to what we need to say anyway.  What you
are really suggesting is that we don't define the obvious terms at all
and simply use them with their assumed meaning, which is certainly an
option.

Then you can't redistribute the software.  The license terms are not
present for an average user to understand -- they ONLY exist to provide
the authors of the code with legal defense against the one-in-a-million
person who hires a lawyer to sue the developers who are doing all of
this for free.  Otherwise, we wouldn't need any license.

It isn't too much to ask the people who do nothing but make money off
of our software to spend five extra minutes reading the license.  If 
they
don't want to do that, we lose nothing.  This is not a popularity 
contest.

The number of FAQs on that topic have proven it.

It defines three terms that are used repeatedly in the license and 
provides
instruction to those who wish to use it.  The latter is why it is both 
at
the beginning and in the appendix -- it is a FAQ.  Defining all of the
terms separately would significantly increase the amount of text that
the reader must understand.  I don't believe that is a good trade-off.

Because there is no signature.  The clause states that you either agree
to all of these terms (hence no signature is needed) or you have no
permission to make copies, etc.

If it is essential, it cannot be done in a footnote.  Legal text is
either defined prior to use or is allowed to be construed in the
reader's favor, which is definitely not the case here.

The only obvious term there is You, and that is defined above for free.
I don't know where you got the idea that there is no legal reason for
definitions occurring before use -- litigation is the reason.  People
file suits all the time on the basis that they did not understand the
contract, and one defense is that the term is not defined or defined
in a place where the reader won't have that definition in mind when
they are reading the terms.  That is why MPL defines them all up front
and why GPL defines them in context of first use.

It says it does not *modify* the terms and conditions of this License.
A statement of license does not modify anything but the reader's
understanding of their permissions.  In any case, the only statement
of license in the example NOTICE file does not refer to the NOTICE file
itself but rather to some portion of the product.

No, the NOTICE file is not allowed to contain additional terms.  It 
exists
solely to provide a place for attributions.  The additional terms are
typically warranty or support-related, which are required by law in
some countries whenever money is exchanged.

Thanks for your comments,

Perhaps you have missed my point.  I'm not suggesting omitting a
definition of these terms -- I'm simply suggesting moving them
downwards in the contract.  There's no legal requirement to define the
terms first -- as long as they are defined in the document.  I think
doing so would greatly increase the readability of the document.

No, that's not what I'm suggesting, although it is, as you say, a
reasonable option.  I'm suggesting that the definitions are subsidiary
and should be moved to a part of the agreement where they don't get so
much in the way.

Here you missed my point completely.  I wasn't suggesting language --
I was making an analogy, which appears to have been completely lost.
The analogy was to contracts which specify "compliance with law",
"agreement to the terms of the contract", or other terms which are
completely subsumed by the concept of legally binding contract.

Sorry, but that's just plain wrong.  Terms can be defined later in the
document, or in other documents incorporated by references.
"Capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions set forth in
section 9, "Definitions."  Done.  Now they're down at the bottom, out
of the way.

Hi all!

I have some questions after reading

http://www.apache.org/licenses/proposed/

...my guess is that they'll all be FAQs...

Goals
-----
 > 4. Compatible with other licenses

The big question of course: is this new license LPGL and/or 
GPL-compatible? Has the FSF been asked to comment on that yet? Have they 
made any kind of statement? Will there be?

License
-------
 >   4. Contributor Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions
 >      of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You:

IIUC, the current license is an agreement between the ASF and "the rest 
of the world". This seems like an agreement between Contributors and 
"the rest of the world". Doesn't that affect the ability of the ASF to 
protect its members from being sued? If so, how?

 >     C. A Contribution is "submitted" when any form of electronic,
 >     verbal, or written communication is sent to the Licensor,
 >     including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
 >     lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
 >     that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose
 >     of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
 >     that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by
 >     the Contributor as "Not a Contribution."

I wonder...what if a contributor sends a patch to a committer via 
private e-mail, or posts it in a comment on a weblog, or something 
similar? Does this clause mean that we should be avoiding such things?

 >      (c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 >          stating that You changed the files.

IIUC this means that if you fork source code and change it, there should 
be a statement like "This file modified by Bla-Blah, Inc. from the ASF 
ones". Perhaps it would be good to have an example of a "prominent 
notice" in the appendix?

Also, does this mean that any change committed to the ASF CVS must 
include notices like this? That seems like a nightmare to ensure!

 >     You may add Your own copyright statement to such modifications and
 >     may provide (sublicense) additional or different license terms and
 >     conditions for use, reproduction, distribution or further
 >     modification of Your modifications, or for the Derivative Work as

 >     stated in this License.

an example of this would also be nice. I believe this says I may copy 
the apache license, change its name, add a few clauses about limiting 
distribution outside the US (for example), assume liability, call it the 
"Bla-Bla, Inc. Open Source License", and distribute ASF-created code 
under that license. Is that correct?

If something like that is possible, doesn't this mean that

 >            Copyright (C) 2003  The Apache Software Foundation.
 >         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 >         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

is in the way? How can I provide additional or different license terms 
if I'm not allowed to change the license document?

thanks!

I believe this says that you may add a copyright notice and
additional license terms to the modified files, for example
"This changed file copyright Leo Simons and licensed under
the GPL". That does not mean you have the right to modify
the Apache license itself. That's not necessary for this
purpose. You can include your own license document and
refer to the Apache license in there.

> is in the way? How can I provide additional or different license terms

"In addition to the terms found in the Apache license 2.0,
the following terms are provided: A, B and C".

Please note that my employer is not to be regarded as a "Contributor"
as defined in the "Apache Community Contribution License".

I'm glad to see that this license contains an explicit sublicenseable copyright
grant.

As noted here,
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/afl-1.2.txt

"The AFL contains a complete copyright grant to the software. The BSD and Apache
licenses are vague and incomplete in that respect."

Section 4 of this license seems to resolve that matter.


Good work,

   Gentlefolk:

   In both the RI and TCK licenses (with only slight variation in
the Ver. 2 wording), we find

>4. Contributor Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions
>   of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You:
>
>   (a) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, [....]; and,
>
>   (b) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up,
>       royalty free, irrevocable (subject to Section 5)
>       patent license [....]

   Hmmm... 4(b) gives me an irrevocable license that Section 5
can revoke?  For my money, it would be clearer, faster, if this
read:

   (b) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up,
       royalty-free patent license, revocable solely under
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
       the terms of Section 5, [....]
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This (as Mr. Goetz says) puts the meat up front.  ``We can
revoke it, but only via Sect. 5'', as opposed to ``We can't
revoke it, and, by the way, that was a lie.''

I am concerned that the definition of Contributors in Section 3 
applies to two different roles.  When a work is submitted to the 
Licensor, there is an actual contributor, the person who submitted the 
code to the mailing list/source control system/etc., and there is the 
person who holds the copyright on the code that the contributor
submitted.  These are not the same people if the person submitting the
work got the code from another program or from an open forum.

Contributor == actual submitter.

Contributor == copyright holder.

Suggestions to disambiguate it:
- Extend Contributor to include people whose works are incorporated
  without their knowledge.
- Break out Contributor and Copyright Holder into separate 
  definitions.

This also affect Section 4, since a contributor that doesn't hold 
copyright to the code can't grant any rights to that work.

first reaction - does not make sense - the contributor must be 
identifiable - multiple persons is not an identifiable entity

this source reasonable

Perhaps it would be a good idea to require that Contributors
represent and warrant they have the copyright to their contribution
or at least the right to license it as required by the Apache license.

That's the wording that was used in the Open Software License 2.0
and the Academic Free License 2.0 (by Larry Rosen). 

The FSF seems to believe such a clause is incompatible with the GPL:
http://www.mail-archive.com/license-discuss@opensource.org/msg06107.html
http://www.mail-archive.com/license-discuss@opensource.org/msg06230.html

Generally speaking, the clause seems unreasonably broad, since
if I get software from you, why should you be allowed to tell
me I cannot sue someone you've never heard of? Giving up patent
rights on your software is generally reasonable (almost all
OSS licenses do that)?

Many companies currently try to find a balance between OSS
and proprietary software. One aspect is the risk they perceive
to their patent portfolio. You can manage this risk by saying
"No, this OSS uses none of our patents" or "Well, this patent
isn't very valuable, let's give it up" for specific pieces of
software, and rejecting any OSS that implements one of your
valuable patents. 

Your proposal makes this approach impossible. The only alternative
left is to say "We have software patents we might want to enforce,
so we cannot use Apache-licensed stuff." It is unrealistic to
believe that companies will say "Oh, in that case we'll just give
up on software patents altogether".

In other words, this broad clause may actually hurt Apache's
installed base in corporations.

This has been discussed quite a bit on the OSI license-discuss list.  The
problem is that this has a hole so big you can drive a truck through it:
imagine someone who wants to cause harm to a patent-holder releasing a
library that implements their patent as open-source-licensed software.
The patent holder, especially if they are an Apache contributor, now has a
pyhrric choice: lose all their patents, or stop using Apache-licensed
software.  Unless the ASF's political mission includes "destroy all
patents", which it does not, it is not in our favor to ask companies to
choose between using Apache and being able to enforce their patents.

Just to expand on this point a bit, an executable built from modified 
source would also count as a derivative work, right? In this case, 
where executables are distributed but source code is not, it is not 
clear to me what is required to be compliant with the license.

I've reviewed the Apache v.2.0 license in detail and think that its 
content and structure go a long way toward accomplishing the stated 
objectives of clarity, ensuring IP protection, addressing contributions 
from those who haven't signed separate CLAs, and compatibility with 
other licenses.  With those objectives in mind, I'd like to propose a 
few revisions (redlines below, clean copy attached) that are intended to 
be consistent with the proposed Individual and Corporate CLAs and to 
otherwise clarify a couple points regarding the licensing and 
redistribution of the code.  Those suggestions are as follows:

Sections 1 and 3(B) -- Revised to reflect that the "Work" may not be an 
"original" work of authorship and could in fact be a redistribution, 
modification, or derivative work distributed under the authorization of 
the copyright owner; under the current licensing structure, the original 
work of authorship (and modifications thereto) is treated as a 
"Contribution."

Section 3(D) -- Revised to ensure that separate CLAs executed by the 
Contributors with the Licensor remain in effect and are not overridden 
by the terms of this license.  Added brief comment to highlight that 
Contributors should only submit code they have written.

Section 4(A) -- Revised to achieve consistency with proposed CLAs.

Section 4(B) -- Revised to achieve consistency with proposed CLAs.  
Also, I understand and appreciate the rationale Roy provided for 
omitting from the patent license the combination of the Contribution 
with works that are publicly available, so in the absence of that text I 
am recommending language to finetune its application to the combination 
of the Contribution with the Work to which it is submitted.  I would 
recommend the same change in text for the CLAs.

Section 5 -- Revised to achieve consistency with proposed CLAs.  
Clarified that modifications to theWork that are also Contributions are 
not excluded from the scope of the defensive termination.

Sections 6 and 7(A) -- Added comment that license is provided for 
informational purposes, consistent with approach in Section 7(B).  Also 
added alternative of making license text available through a web site 
link, in order to streamline documentation requirements.

Sections 6 and 7(C) -- Clarified that end-user can distribute both 
unmodified and modified code under different terms, subject to the 
requirements of this license.

My only other comment regarding the CLAs is with respect to the 
Corporate version.  I would recommend the deletion of the second half of 
Section 5, which provides that the company must include details of 
third-party licenses/restrictions "of which it is personally aware."  
Because there can be employees in a company (particularly a large one) 
who may have knowledge of such restrictions but who are not 
participating in a given project, it is difficult, if not impossible, 
for the company to make this commitment; it can only do so through the 
employees who are actively involved.  The Individual CLA already places 
that obligation on the participating employees, so I believe that the 
objective is still attained.

Thanks to everyone for their consideration of these comments, as well as 
the tremendous efforts that have gone into these licenses.

                      http://www.apache.org/licenses/

             Copyright (C) 2003  The Apache Software Foundation.
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS
           FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

   1. Licensing the Work. These terms and conditions for use, 
reproduction, distribution, and modification (the "License") apply to 
*the* any original work of  authorship (the "Work") containing a notice 
placed by *or under the authorization of* the copyright owner (the 
"Licensor") indicating that the Work is licensed under the Apache 
License, Version 2.0.

   2. You. "You" or "You" means an individual or legal entity exercising 
permissions granted by this License. By exercising any of the 
permissions granted to You in Sections 4 through 8 herein, You indicate 
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

   3. Contributors and Contributions.

      A. The Licensor and any individual or legal entity that 
voluntarily submits to the Licensor a Contribution to the Work are 
collectively addressed herein as "Contributors". For legal entities, the 
entity  making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are 
 controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are 
considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this 
definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause 
the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or 
 otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      B. A "Contribution" is the original version of the Work and *or* 
any modification or addition to the Work that has been submitted for 
inclusion in the Work, where *such original version of the Work or* such 
modifications and/or additions to the Work originate from that 
particular Contributor, or from some entity acting on behalf of that 
 Contributor.

      C. A Contribution is "submitted" when any form of electronic, 
verbal, or written communication is sent to the Licensor,  including but 
not limited to communication on electronic mailing  lists, source code 
control systems, and issue tracking systems  that are managed by, or on 
behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose  of discussing and improving the 
Work, but excluding communication  that is conspicuously marked or 
otherwise designated in writing by the Contributor as "Not a Contribution."

      D. *Unless You explicitly state otherwise in the submission, a*ny 
 Contribution submitted by You to the Licensor shall be under the 
terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions, unless You explicitly state otherwise in the submission.  
*Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any separate license agreement you may have  executed with 
Licensor regarding such Contribution.  You should not submit as a 
"Contribution" code that is not Your original creation.*  

   4. Contributor Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions  
of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You:

       (a) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty 
free, irrevocable copyright license under its licensable copyrights in 
the Work to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute *its Contribution(s)* the 
Work and such derivative works; and,

      (b) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty 
free, irrevocable (subject to Section 5) patent license to make, have 
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer *its 
Contribution(s)* the Work and derivative works thereof, where such 
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such 
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution*(s)* 
alone or *where the infringement is caused* by combination of their 
*such* Contribution*(s)* *when combined* with the Work to which such 
Contribution(s) was submitted by the Contributor.

 No assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Work does  not 
infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of  any other 
entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to You for claims 
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual 
property rights or otherwise. You assume sole    responsibility to 
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

   5. Reciprocity.  If you institute patent litigation against a 
Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses 
granted by that Contributor to You under this License shall terminate as 
of the date such litigation is filed.  In addition, *I*f You institute 
patent litigation against any entity  (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that *a Contribution and/or* the 
Work itself, *without modification (other than modifications that are 
Contribution(s)), constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement,* (excluding combinations of the Work with other software 
or hardware) infringes your patent(s), then any patent licenses granted 
to You under this License for that *Contribution or such* Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   6. Redistribution without Modification. You may reproduce and 
distribute verbatim copies of the Work as You received it, in any 
medium, provided that You conspicuously publish on each copy an 
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, keep intact all 
of the notices that refer to this License and to the      absence of any 
warranty, and give any other recipients of the Work *for informational 
purposes* a copy of this License along with the Work* or a link to a web 
site where the License may be obtained. You may provide (sublicense) 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, 
reproduction, distribution or modification of the Work, provided that 
Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies 
with the conditions stated in this License*.

   7. Redistribution with Modification. You may modify Your copy or 
copies of the Work or any portion of it, thus forming another work 
product based on the Work (a "Derivative Work"), and reproduce and 
distribute such  modifications or the Derivative Work, provided that You 
also meet the following conditions:

       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Derivative Work 
*for informational purposes* a copy of this License along with the 
Derivative Work* or a link to a web site where the License may be obtained*.

       (b) You must retain, in the source code of any Derivative Work 
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from 
the source code of the Work, excluding those notices that only pertain 
to portions   of the Work that have been excluded from the Derivative 
Work. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" file as part of its source code 
distribution,     the Derivative Work must include a readable copy of 
the notices contained within that NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that only pertain to portions of the Work that have been excluded from 
the Derivative Work, in at least one of the following places: *(i)* 
within a NOTICE file distributed as part of the Derivative Work; *(ii)* 
within the source code or documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative Work; or, *(iii)* within a display generated by the 
Derivative Work, if   and wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. You may add Your own notices alongside or as an addendum to the 
original NOTICE  information. The contents of the NOTICE file are for 
informational purposes only and do not modify the terms and conditions 
of this License.

      (c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
stating that You changed the files.

You may add Your own copyright statement to such modifications and may 
provide (sublicense) additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, distribution or further 
modification of Your modifications, or for the Derivative Work as a 
whole, provided that *Your use, reproduction, distribution and 
modification of the Work otherwise* the sublicense complies with the 
conditions stated in this License.

  8. Redistribution with Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, 
and/or  to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity, or liability 
obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license 
granted herein ("Additional Terms"). However, You may do so only on Your 
own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other 
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,  and hold every 
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted 
against, such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

  9. Trademarks. Aside from reproduction of the information within the 
NOTICE file and references to the License itself, this License does not 
grant permission to use the trademarks, trade names, service marks, or 
product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and 
customary "fair use" while describing the origin of the Work. Further 
information on guidelines for use of related marks and/or how to obtain 
permission for use of those marks may be found in the NOTICE file, if 
any is included with the Work.

  10. Disclaimer of Warranty. The Work is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or  
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of 
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness 
of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated   
with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 11. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal  
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or  otherwise, 
shall any Contributor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, 
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising 
as a result of this License or the use of the     Work including, 
without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages 
or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for 
death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the 
extent applicable law prohibits such   limitation. Some jurisdictions do 
not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential 
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

ons granted to You in Sections 4 through 8 herein, You indicate 	Your acc=
eptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

   3. Contributors and Contributions.

      A. The Licensor and any individual or legal entity that voluntarily=
 	submits to the Licensor a Contribution to the Work are collectively 	ad=
dressed herein as "Contributors". For legal entities, the entity 	making =
a Contribution and all other entities that control, are 	controlled by, o=
r are under common control with	that entity are 	considered to be a singl=
e Contributor. For the purposes of this 	definition, "control" means (i) =
the power, direct or indirect, to cause 	the direction or management of s=
uch entity, whether by contract or 	otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty=
 percent (50%) or more of the 	outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ow=
nership of such entity.

      B. A "Contribution" is the original version of the Work or any
      modification or addition to the Work that has been submitted for
      inclusion in the Work, where such original version of the Work or s=
uch 	modifications and/or additions to the Work originate from that 	part=
icular Contributor, or from some entity acting on behalf of that 	Contrib=
utor.=20

      C. A Contribution is "submitted" when any form of electronic,
      verbal, or written communication is sent to the Licensor,
      including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
      lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
      that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose
      of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
      that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by
      the Contributor as "Not a Contribution."

      D. Unless you explicitly state otherwise in the submission, any 	Co=
ntribution submitted by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms 	and=
 conditions of this License, without any additional terms or 	conditions.=
  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede 	or modify th=
e terms of any separate license agreement you may have 	executed with Lic=
ensor regarding such Contribution.  You should not 	submit as a =93Contri=
bution=94 code that is not Your original creation.  =20

   4. Contributor Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions
      of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You:

ution(s) and derivative works thereof, where such license 	applies only t=
o those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that 	are necessaril=
y infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or where the 	infringement is =
caused by such Contribution(s) when combined  with the 	Work to which suc=
h Contribution(s) was submitted by the Contributor.=20

      No assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Work does
      not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of
      any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to You
      for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
      intellectual property rights or otherwise. You assume sole
      responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
      needed, if any.

   5. Reciprocity. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
      (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging tha=
t a 		Contribution and/or the Work, without modification (other than 	mod=

informational purposes a copy of this License along with the Derivative 	=
Work or a link to a web site where the License may be obtained.

) within a display generated by the Derivative Work, if 	and wherever suc=
h third-party notices normally appear. You may add Your 	own notices alon=
gside or as an addendum to the original NOTICE 	information. The contents=
 of the NOTICE file are for informational 	purposes only and do not modif=
y the terms and conditions of this 	License.

      (c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 	s=
tating that You changed the files.

      obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the
      license granted herein ("Additional Terms"). However, You may do so=
 	only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, not on behalf =
	of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 	a=
nd hold every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 	cla=
ims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of any such 	Additional =
Terms.

   9. Trademarks. Aside from reproduction of the information within the
      NOTICE file and references to the License itself, this License does=

y is included with the Work.

  10. Disclaimer of Warranty. The Work is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or condition=
s of 	TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICUL=
AR 	PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriatene=
ss 	of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 	=
with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  11. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
      theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
      otherwise, shall any Contributor be liable to any person for any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of
      any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the=
 	Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work =
	stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other 	commerc=
ial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not 	apply to l=
iability for death or personal injury resulting from 	Licensor's negligen=
ce to the extent applicable law prohibits such 	limitation. Some jurisdic=
tions do not allow the exclusion or limitation 	of incidental or conseque=
ntial damages, so this exclusion and 	limitation may not apply to You.

The subscribers of the debian-legal list have examined all three of the
proposed licenses and it seems that the consensus is that none of the
licenses are Free Software licenses, according to the Debian Free
Software Guidelines. You can see the thread of discussion starting at
[0]. The problems that have been pointed out will need to be fixed
before the software license will be judged free. It would also be a good
idea to run it by debian-legal one more time, so that we can take a look
over it and make sure everything is okay.

The consequences of the license of Apache being non-free (I realize it
has not yet been adopted) is that it would be placed in the non-free
archive, which is not a part of Debian. Software in non-free is not
autobuilt for any architecture (there are 11 on Linux alone) and it does
not receive the same level of quality assurance as software in main
does. It is also possible that non-free will disappear soon.


I am not a Debian Developer, nor do I speak for anyone but myself. I am
not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice. I have set the
Mail-Followup-To: to both license@apache and debian-legal@l.d.o.

Although the clause itself seems a reasonable defense, isn't it
rather dangerous to rely on judges to determine whether the
patent is "applicable to software"? 

Say we have a patent on an audio coding technique, and the patent
has a claim on a chip and on a computer program. Is this a "patent
applicable to software", and does the clause apply if we assert
this patent against someone whose chips infringe our patent?

How about:
If you institute patent litigation against a Contributor alleging
that a computer program by itself infringes on a patent (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses
granted by that Contributor to You under this License shall terminate as
of the date such litigation is filed.

I've reviewed the Apache v.2.0 license in detail and think that its 
content and structure go a long way toward accomplishing the stated 
objectives of clarity, ensuring IP protection, addressing contributions 
from those who haven't signed separate CLAs, and compatibility with 
other licenses.  With those objectives in mind, I'd like to propose a 
few revisions (redlines below, clean copy attached) that are intended to 
be consistent with the proposed Individual and Corporate CLAs and to 
otherwise clarify a couple points regarding the licensing and 
redistribution of the code.  Those suggestions are as follows:

Sections 1 and 3(B) -- Revised to reflect that the "Work" may not be an 
"original" work of authorship and could in fact be a redistribution, 
modification, or derivative work distributed under the authorization of 
the copyright owner; under the current licensing structure, the original 
work of authorship (and modifications thereto) is treated as a 
"Contribution."

Section 3(D) -- Revised to ensure that separate CLAs executed by the 
Contributors with the Licensor remain in effect and are not overridden 
by the terms of this license.  Added brief comment to highlight that 
Contributors should only submit code they have written.

Section 4(A) -- Revised to achieve consistency with proposed CLAs.

Section 4(B) -- Revised to achieve consistency with proposed CLAs.  
Also, I understand and appreciate the rationale Roy provided for 
omitting from the patent license the combination of the Contribution 
with works that are publicly available, so in the absence of that text I 
am recommending language to finetune its application to the combination 
of the Contribution with the Work to which it is submitted.  I would 
recommend the same change in text for the CLAs.

Section 5 -- Revised to achieve consistency with proposed CLAs.  
Clarified that modifications to theWork that are also Contributions are 
not excluded from the scope of the defensive termination.

Sections 6 and 7(A) -- Added comment that license is provided for 
informational purposes, consistent with approach in Section 7(B).  Also 
added alternative of making license text available through a web site 
link, in order to streamline documentation requirements.

Sections 6 and 7(C) -- Clarified that end-user can distribute both 
unmodified and modified code under different terms, subject to the 
requirements of this license.

My only other comment regarding the CLAs is with respect to the 
Corporate version.  I would recommend the deletion of the second half of 
Section 5, which provides that the company must include details of 
third-party licenses/restrictions "of which it is personally aware."  
Because there can be employees in a company (particularly a large one) 
who may have knowledge of such restrictions but who are not 
participating in a given project, it is difficult, if not impossible, 
for the company to make this commitment; it can only do so through the 
employees who are actively involved.  The Individual CLA already places 
that obligation on the participating employees, so I believe that the 
objective is still attained.

Thanks to everyone for their consideration of these comments, as well as 
the tremendous efforts that have gone into these licenses.

                                    Apache License
                         Version 2.0, October 2003
                      http://www.apache.org/licenses/

             Copyright (C) 2003  The Apache Software Foundation.
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS
           FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

   1. Licensing the Work. These terms and conditions for use, 
reproduction, distribution, and modification (the "License") apply to 
*the* any original work of  authorship (the "Work") containing a notice 
placed by *or under the authorization of* the copyright owner (the 
"Licensor") indicating that the Work is licensed under the Apache 
License, Version 2.0.

   2. You. "You" or "You" means an individual or legal entity exercising 
permissions granted by this License. By exercising any of the 
permissions granted to You in Sections 4 through 8 herein, You indicate 
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

   3. Contributors and Contributions.

      A. The Licensor and any individual or legal entity that 
voluntarily submits to the Licensor a Contribution to the Work are 
collectively addressed herein as "Contributors". For legal entities, the 
entity  making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are 
 controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are 
considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this 
definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause 
the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or 
 otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      B. A "Contribution" is the original version of the Work and *or* 
any modification or addition to the Work that has been submitted for 
inclusion in the Work, where *such original version of the Work or* such 
modifications and/or additions to the Work originate from that 
particular Contributor, or from some entity acting on behalf of that 
 Contributor.

      C. A Contribution is "submitted" when any form of electronic, 
verbal, or written communication is sent to the Licensor,  including but 
not limited to communication on electronic mailing  lists, source code 
control systems, and issue tracking systems  that are managed by, or on 
behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose  of discussing and improving the 
Work, but excluding communication  that is conspicuously marked or 
otherwise designated in writing by the Contributor as "Not a Contribution."

      D. *Unless You explicitly state otherwise in the submission, a*ny 
 Contribution submitted by You to the Licensor shall be under the 
terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions, unless You explicitly state otherwise in the submission.  
*Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any separate license agreement you may have  executed with 
Licensor regarding such Contribution.  You should not submit as a 
"Contribution" code that is not Your original creation.*  

   4. Contributor Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions  
of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You:

       (a) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty 
free, irrevocable copyright license under its licensable copyrights in 
the Work to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute *its Contribution(s)* the 
Work and such derivative works; and,

      (b) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty 
free, irrevocable (subject to Section 5) patent license to make, have 
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer *its 
Contribution(s)* the Work and derivative works thereof, where such 
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such 
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution*(s)* 
alone or *where the infringement is caused* by combination of their 
*such* Contribution*(s)* *when combined* with the Work to which such 
Contribution(s) was submitted by the Contributor.

 No assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Work does  not 
infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of  any other 
entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to You for claims 
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual 
property rights or otherwise. You assume sole    responsibility to 
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

   5. Reciprocity.  If you institute patent litigation against a 
Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses 
granted by that Contributor to You under this License shall terminate as 
of the date such litigation is filed.  In addition, *I*f You institute 
patent litigation against any entity  (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that *a Contribution and/or* the 
Work itself, *without modification (other than modifications that are 
Contribution(s)), constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement,* (excluding combinations of the Work with other software 
or hardware) infringes your patent(s), then any patent licenses granted 
to You under this License for that *Contribution or such* Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   6. Redistribution without Modification. You may reproduce and 
distribute verbatim copies of the Work as You received it, in any 
medium, provided that You conspicuously publish on each copy an 
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, keep intact all 
of the notices that refer to this License and to the      absence of any 
warranty, and give any other recipients of the Work *for informational 
purposes* a copy of this License along with the Work* or a link to a web 
site where the License may be obtained. You may provide (sublicense) 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, 
reproduction, distribution or modification of the Work, provided that 
Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies 
with the conditions stated in this License*.

   7. Redistribution with Modification. You may modify Your copy or 
copies of the Work or any portion of it, thus forming another work 
product based on the Work (a "Derivative Work"), and reproduce and 
distribute such  modifications or the Derivative Work, provided that You 
also meet the following conditions:

       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Derivative Work 
*for informational purposes* a copy of this License along with the 
Derivative Work* or a link to a web site where the License may be obtained*.

       (b) You must retain, in the source code of any Derivative Work 
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from 
the source code of the Work, excluding those notices that only pertain 
to portions   of the Work that have been excluded from the Derivative 
Work. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" file as part of its source code 
distribution,     the Derivative Work must include a readable copy of 
the notices contained within that NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that only pertain to portions of the Work that have been excluded from 
the Derivative Work, in at least one of the following places: *(i)* 
within a NOTICE file distributed as part of the Derivative Work; *(ii)* 
within the source code or documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative Work; or, *(iii)* within a display generated by the 
Derivative Work, if   and wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. You may add Your own notices alongside or as an addendum to the 
original NOTICE  information. The contents of the NOTICE file are for 
informational purposes only and do not modify the terms and conditions 
of this License.

      (c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
stating that You changed the files.

You may add Your own copyright statement to such modifications and may 
provide (sublicense) additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, distribution or further 
modification of Your modifications, or for the Derivative Work as a 
whole, provided that *Your use, reproduction, distribution and 
modification of the Work otherwise* the sublicense complies with the 
conditions stated in this License.

  8. Redistribution with Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, 
and/or  to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity, or liability 
obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license 
granted herein ("Additional Terms"). However, You may do so only on Your 
own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other 
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,  and hold every 
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted 
against, such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

  9. Trademarks. Aside from reproduction of the information within the 
NOTICE file and references to the License itself, this License does not 
grant permission to use the trademarks, trade names, service marks, or 
product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and 
customary "fair use" while describing the origin of the Work. Further 
information on guidelines for use of related marks and/or how to obtain 
permission for use of those marks may be found in the NOTICE file, if 
any is included with the Work.

  10. Disclaimer of Warranty. The Work is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or  
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of 
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness 
of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated   
with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 11. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal  
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or  otherwise, 
shall any Contributor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, 
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising 
as a result of this License or the use of the     Work including, 
without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages 
or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for 
death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the 
extent applicable law prohibits such   limitation. Some jurisdictions do 
not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential 
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

iability for death or personal injury resulting from 	Licensor's negligen=
ce to the extent applicable law prohibits such 	limitation. Some jurisdic=

Arnoud, you are a patent attorney as is Jennifer (if my guess is correct
about her being Duke Law, Class of '93), so I won't get into the legal
aspect, but simply as a matter of fact, as I read her modifications, the
finished paragraph read:

   5. Reciprocity. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
      (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that a
Contribution and/or the Work, without modification (other than
modifications that are Contribution(s)), constitutes direct or 	contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to 	You under this
License for that Contribution or such Work shall 		terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.

which seems similar to your:

Do you concur, after you re-read her message?

Sorry to but in- I'm not an attorney either, but one thing that bothered
me about the original was that the scope of this section (5) appeared 
to extend beyond "this Work".  I much prefer the above language over the
original.

I'd say the crux of the difference is that "a computer program" isn't
necessarily the one offered under this license.

My apologies, it appears I only looked at the old version
and missed this update. 

> Do you concur, after you re-read her message?

The above clause essentially says that you may not sue anyone
for patent infringement regarding the work or any contribution
thereto. The clause I talked about was much broader and talked
about asserting _any_ patent "applicable to software". 

I don't think anyone has a problem with the above clause.

As it turned out, I looked at the plaintext version of Jennifer's
e-mail. She had included a redlined version, but the plaintext
version of that simply had all the text and none of the strikeouts
so all deleted language appeared again.

Guess that's what you get for using a text-based mailer :)

I have read the comments.  Why are people "judging" the "freeness"
of software according to the DFSG without actually referring to the
DFSG itself?  DFSG determines what is or is not free for Debian, not
someone gabbing on a mailing list, and certainly not a "consensus"
as expressed by three individuals.

    http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines

Some comments are to the effect that the contributor license is
assigning copyright.  Those comments are misinformed.  Even our signed
CLAs only give the ASF a license.

Several comments are to the effect that the patent license cannot be
terminated.  There is no such restriction in the DFSG.  Furthermore,
the GPL, BSD, and other licenses that Debian claims are free have no
patent license grant at all, which is equivalent to a terminated
license. If the proposed 2.0 license is non-free, then none of your
example licenses are free either.

Your comment regarding "I think that we have prohibited such
litigation-termination licenses as non-free" only applies to
clauses that terminate the ENTIRE license, copyright and patent.
Our termination clause only applies to the patent license -- it has
no effect on redistribution, and no additional effect on use than
what would exist without the patent grant.

One comment is that the NOTICE file might contain a tome of work
that isn't appropriate as a requirement for redistribution.  That
comment is sensible and should be addressed.  However, I will note
that no such restriction exists in the DFSG, since it is well within
the scope of DFSG.4.  It is thus entirely "free", even if it is a
bad idea.

One comment is to the effect that the NOTICE file must contain
legally required terms of use.  That is absurd -- there is no such
restriction in DFSG.  Another comment indicates that allowing
advertisement notices (a.k.a., attribution) in the NOTICE file
would make it not GPL-compatible -- that comment is hopelessly
misinformed.  The GPL does not oppose attribution notices within
the source code -- it even requires them in some cases.  The GPL
compatibility requires that the GPL itself be the superset of all
terms of the derived work, which it would be in this case.  The fact
that GPL requires distribution of source using exactly the same
words as the NOTICE condition makes it sufficient.

One comment is to the effect that the RI and TCK agreements
are not free because they restrict the manner in which a trademarked
namespace can be modified *and* redistributed.  Such restrictions are
well within the constraints of DFSG.4.  Whether or not individuals
dislike it is not relevant -- it is a requirement passed down by
the Java Community Process.  AFAIK, Debian does not redistribute
Java software, so neither the RI nor the TCK licenses apply to Debian.

One comment is that it is 48K of text.  The copy I wrote, including
all of the example text and panic disclaimer, is 13935 bytes, and
the terms and conditions are 1426 words.  The GPL is 18007 bytes,
with 2004 words in the T&C.

Given the number of times Debian has violated our original Apache
license by redistributing modified versions of Apache httpd as if
they were the original, but actually containing security faults
and installation incompatibilities introduced by your repackaging
and addition of unreviewed "features", it would actually be a relief
not to be distributed in Debian.

However, the comments suggesting that the 2.0 license is not "free"
have no basis in the DFSG.  There are many good reasons for not

My apologies!  I sent in both plaintext and HTML and hoped that 
including both a redlined and clean version would resolve any 
discrepancies.  The "clean" copy should reflect my recommended language 
without any of the deletions appearing.

Because there is no such thing as software that isn't covered by at
least a dozen patents, most of them applying to the languages used
in writing the software itself.  The ASF is a nonprofit corporation
and does not have any patents.  What we are trying to prevent is a
patent owner submitting a contribution that includes the patented or
patent-pending material for the purpose of later suing those who
use the larger work. The patent itself might not even be granted yet,
let alone be publicly known.

Which is why the patent license has no impact on the "free"ness of
the software in question, regardless of what that software will be.

And the same can be said of the proposed Apache license -- under no
circumstance will it become non-free *because of that license*.

Argh!  There is nothing Debian-specific in the license itself.
Read the DFSG.  Re-interpreting its clauses in such a grossly
unsupported fashion does nothing but disgrace your process for
reviewing licenses.

The G in "DFSG" is for "Guidelines". We take that expansion seriously.
The DFSG is not a computer program or a mathematical formula that will
give an objective, reproducible answer if you stick in a license text
and crank the handle. It is a piece of prose that aims to give readers
a feel for what we check when we determine if software is free enough
to be distributed by Debian. Sometimes it does not achieve that goal,
which is too bad, but is not going to change the actual judgements we
make.

> and certainly not a "consensus" as expressed by three individuals.

For better or worse, the debian-legal consensus *is* the operative
defintion of what is or is not rejected from Debian on licensing
grounds. (Unless overruled by higher powers, who are few and have
other principal duties to see to, that is).

> Several comments are to the effect that the patent license cannot be
> terminated.  There is no such restriction in the DFSG.

The DFSG says that free software must be usable by anyone without
doing any specific favors towards upstream authors or patent
holders. If a piece of software is encumbered by patents that are not
available to anyone without jumping through hoops (such as agreeing to
not sue some upstream contributor), then the software is not free.

A program covered by the GPL or BSD is indeed not free if it happens
to be encumbered by a patent that somebody is enforcing actively.

The precense of a (limited) patent grant in your license makes it
natural to assume that the program in question *is* (or is expected to
be) encumbered by such patents. If there are no relevant patents at
all, then of course the patent grant and the restriction are both
no-ops, but then why have them there at all?

> If the proposed 2.0 license is non-free, then none of your example
> licenses are free either.

Licenses are not free by themselves. Software may be free. The
copyright license plays a big role in determining whether that is the
case, but the judgement cannot be made for a license without
considering it in relation to the software it applies to.

What we say is the software licences under the GPL or the BSD license
will not be non-free *because of that license*. There may still be
patent issues that prevent such software from being included in Debian.

> However, I will note that no such restriction exists in the DFSG,

See comments above.

> That is absurd -- there is no such restriction in DFSG.

See comments above.

Which is not at all an argument that it is necessarily free.

There's plenty of Java in Debian...

... and in any case, free licenses cannot be specific to Debian.

I don't see it as being unreasonable.  A patent-based attack on an open =

before I start implementing seems pretty unreasonable to me.  "If we do =

The clause only prevents them from enforcing these rights against open =
source software, which is what we want.  Large companies routinely =
implement cross-licensing agreements; non-agression pacts under which =
they promise not to sue each other for patent licenses.  Mutual patent =
defence clauses apply this principle to open source.

There may be a "protect it or lose it" principle in patent law, such =
that if a patent holder fails to sue an open source project that =
violates a patent then the patent becomes unenforceable against other =
parties.  If so then perhaps the clause could say that patent holders =
who use Apache-licensed software automatically grant a free =
non-exclusive license to all their patents to all OSS licensed software, =
and the patent license can be revoked by ceasing to use the =
Apache-licensed package and destroying all copies.  This has a similar =
effect to the mutual defence clause, but the patent-holder can get the =
patent back at any time and in the mean time does not lose the right to =
sue other violators.  It also has the effect of making the license =
GPL-compatible, since it is never withdrawn.

In another email Brian Behlendorf writes:

OK, so what if they do?  If the library is useful then its just another =
useful piece of OSS, and the motives of the author are irrelevant.  If =
it is not useful then the attack on the patent holder fails because it =
makes no difference to their income.

The only way I can see such an attack being useful is if the would-be =
violator releases just enough of their source code as OSS to escape the =
patent whilst keeping the rest of their package wrapped up in secrecy.  =
This can be solved by phrasing the patent-license-grant clause to not =
cover anyone who incorporates OSS (from whatever source) in a =
closed-source package.  They can negotiate for licenses like anyone =
else.

Paul.

Apart from any other issues with this section, what if the Work contains

They can't be removed via this clause because they don't pertain to "portions of
the Work that have been excluded from the Derivative Work".

Consider a rewrite, in both places where this phrase occurs, to
", excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Work."

Thanks.

This first clause applies to any lawsuit against any contributor 
regarding any patent "applicable to software".  This is *way* too broad 
to be free.  Suppose SCO had been a Contributor and had granted an 
appropriate patent license.  Then IBM would lose its patent license 
under this License due to an *entirely different* case not connected to 
this work.  Further, suppose that there exists one legitimate patent 
somewhere in the world which is applicable to software -- it cannot be 
enforced against any contributor ever without losing the Apache 
license.  That's quite a bizarre and extreme requirement.

In contrast, this second clause should be considered DFSG-free, I 
believe.  It states that claiming that *this work* infringes your 
patents causes your patent licenses for *this work* to be terminated.  
This is a clause protecting the work's freeness, which *only* applies to 
people attempting to make the work non-free.

Anyone else agree with my assessment?  :-)

So, uh, no copyright notices or trademark notices, right?  Those have 
non-informational purposes.

What is supposed to be in this NOTICE file anyway?...

These NOTICE requirements appear on the face of it to be 
GPL-incompatible (for any work which has a NOTICE file), since they add 
extra requirements.

Copyright notices can't be legally removed (from redistributed copies) 
anyway. 

Trademark notices are not required when using a trademark in a legal 
manner; the GPL doesn't require it, the FSF actually discourages it, and 
so this is probably another GPL incompatibility.

Really, what is the *purpose* of these changes?  I'm sure a better set 
of terms can be devised that accomplish the intended purpose without 
diving into this morass.

What GPL are you reading?  Please show me the part of the GPL which uses
"exactly the same words as the NOTICE condition".  I went through it several times,
and it simply doesn't.  

Perhaps you are thinking of this requirement from GPL 1? :  "...keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;..."

The "NOTICE" condition as written in the draft Apache licenses is not specifically
restricted to notices "that refer to this License [the GPL] and to the absence of
any warranty"; accordingly, it's a stronger condition, and is GPL-incompatible.

OK, this is not really a good idea.  I know the GPL did this, but it's a bad idea and
should not be copied.

There are two cases:
(1) Legal texts are freely modifiable, or not copyrightable, by law in your jurisdiction.
(This is believed to be the case in the US.)  In this case, this is an illegal,
inoperative, and misleading restriction.

(2) Legal texts *are* fully copyrightable and not freely modifiable.  In this case, you
have just made Jennifer Machovic's proposed alterations 
(http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=license@apache.org&msgNo=24)
into a copyright violation.  This is inappropriate.

What you want is a clause like this:

"Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document.   Distribution of modified copies is only allowed
if you make it clear that the modified copy is *not* the actual Apache License."

           ... If the Work includes a
           "NOTICE" file as part of its source code distribution, the
           Derivative Work must include a readable copy of the notices

           the Derivative Work; ***within the source code or

           if provided along with the Derivative Work**; ...

       You may add Your own copyright statement to such modifications and

       modification of Your modifications, or for the Derivative Work as
       a whole, provided that the sublicense complies with the conditions

That particular goal is quite acceptable (and a very good idea, IMO.)
The primary issue debian-legal has with this clause is the Reciprocity
aspect of it.

A clause that enables the license to a piece of IP in a piece of Free
Software to be revokable is a useage restriction, and as such, not
DSFG Free.[1] [It fails DFSG #5 and #6.]

Hopefully that clears this up some.

The attackers hadn't simply robbed the bank. They had carried off
everything portable, including the security cameras, the carpets, the
chairs, and the light and plumbing fixtures. The conspirators had
deliberately punished the bank, for reasons best known to themselves,
or to their unknown controllers. They had superglued doors and
shattered windows, severed power and communications cables, poured
stnking toxins into the wallspaces, and concreted all of the sinks and
drains. In eight minutes, sixty people had ruined the building so
thouroughly that it had to be condemed and later demolished.

That is better.  I wish we could find a shorter version, or just leave

Assuming you mean "revokable under some condition" (not just "revokable
at whim", which is obviously non-free), wouldn't this include GPL #4?

I'm not suggesting that the GPL is non-free, or that the proposed
clause in question is free; just that this statement seems overly
broad.

You're correct; it is badly worded (and upon reflection doesn't mean
exactly what I intented it to.)

To clarify: GPL #4 in itself isn't a useage restriction because the
GPL doesn't concern itself with useage at all, only copying,
modifying, and distributing.

What I was attempting to verbalize (rather badly) is that software
licenses should never restrict useage. Furthermore, they should only
restrict modification, copying, and distribution when it serves a
clear and present goal of improving the freedom of software itself.

The GPL says "if you violate this license, this license is revoked".
The proposed license says (roughly) "if you sue us, this license is
revoked".  How is one a use restriction and the other not?

I'm not arguing for the license termination terms--I'm undecided about
that--this just feels like the wrong line of reasoning.

It's easy to argue that the patent-related terms here do that (or might
with improved phrasing).  It's difficult to say whether it outweighs
the restrictions, since the side-effects of the restrictions aren't
obvious to me.

The GPL doesn't concern itself with useage. You can use a GPLed piece
of software no matter what you have done, even if you've violated the
license.[1] What it restricts is your ability to copy, modify, and
distribute the work.

In the second case, if the license purports to involve useage, which
(for example) the Apache Software Licenses do, a revocable license is
a useage restriction.

[Just for clarity, if the GPL did not include section 0, section 4
would be a useage restriction, assuming you agreed that the GPL
controlled use of the software.]

I'd be happy with the patent related terms if we got rid of the
reciprocity portion of it. That's my main concern with that section.

The only argument I've seen so far for the reciprocity section is that
companies might be unwilling to grant the work such a license without
it... I personally don't see this any different having a reciprocity
section involving copyright instead of patents.

For those documents, e.g., the CLA or Software Grant, that need to be sent
to the ASF, should we make sure that each one has the instructions, and
those include not just a FAX and USnail address, but also an e-mail address
to which they can be submitted digitally, e.g., a scanned image of the
signed and completed form?

The license does not restrict usage at all.  The outside universe of
patent law restricts usage.  The contributors are granting a freedom
that did not exist before on the premise that everyone benefiting
from the work also grants that freedom.  Without reciprocity, no such
license will be given, and thus no grant is made.  The only reason
that the license even mentions usage is for the sake of granting
permission to use.

Termination of the patent license does not imply that the recipient
cannot use the software.  If they have a license via some other means,
do not believe the patent is enforceable, or simply do not use the
software in a way that would cause infringement, then even the loss of
the specific patent grant in this license does not affect their rights.
Nowhere does it say that the recipient cannot use the software without
that patent license, nor does it imply that such a patent would be
valid or enforceable.  In short, it doesn't restrict freedom other
than the new freedom that was given by the patent grant.

These particular arguments apply equally well to copyright law. [Eg,
if termination of a copyright license doesn't imply that the recipient
can't use the software either if they have a license via some other
means.] Furthermore, there are a substantial number of contributors
who might be interested in copyright reciprocity clauses as well.

Is there any particular reason why the reciprocity clause needs to be
added? [Which contributors|contributions are under discussion
here?[1]] If the contributor isn't interested in freely licensing
their patent claims, perhaps they shouldn't be contributing code that
covers their patent?

Again, what I'm seriously concerned about is the vast number of users
who use and/or modify Apache licensed software that is present in
Debian suddenly being unable to make a counterclaim in a litigiation
against them without having the patents of the supposedly free
software they are using becomming an issue when they weren't
previously. [As I'm sure, you're concerned about contributors sneaking
in patent protected code and then attempting to enjoin and/or charge
users of Apache for.]

The attackers hadn't simply robbed the bank. They had carried off
everything portable, including the security cameras, the carpets, the
chairs, and the light and plumbing fixtures. The conspirators had
deliberately punished the bank, for reasons best known to themselves,
or to their unknown controllers. They had superglued doors and
shattered windows, severed power and communications cables, poured
stnking toxins into the wallspaces, and concreted all of the sinks and
drains. In eight minutes, sixty people had ruined the building so
thouroughly that it had to be condemed and later demolished.

At HP there is one set of open source licenses that gets more critical
pushback than any other, and the GPL is not in that set. It is the IBM
Public License (and its cousin the Common PL) and the Mozilla Public
License 1.1 (and its cousin NPL 1.1). That heightened scrutiny is due to
a single sentence -- a sentence which is now proposed to be added to the
Apache license as the first sentence of section 5:

"If You institute patent litigation against a Contributor with respect
to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
Contributor to You under this License shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed."

Because the trigger of this termination is unrelated to the software
being licensed, (in contrast to the second sentence of section 5) there
is no good way to manage that termination risk. The addition of that
sentence would require an entirely new perspective on use of software
under the Apache license. Further, companies that consider incorporating
software under this license into a product that they will redistribute
will need to convince their customers that using software with this sort
of licensing contingency is a risk that the customer ought to take.

>From the list of goals, it appears that there may be belief that this
section somehow addresses goal 5: "It would be nice to have some
language in the license that protected us from patent-infringement
suits, at the very least from contributors if not in more general ways.
Solved in 2.0."

For any "us" that does not own a patent that applies to software
licensed under the Apache license, section 5 provides no benefit
whatsoever. The benefit provided by section 5 is a benefit that only
applies to patent owners: if you don't have a patent (in particular, if
you don't have a patent that applies to the Apache-licensed software),
then you aren't granting any license that is terminated by section 5;
section 5 gives you neither leverage nor other benefit.=20

The first sentence of section 5 should be struck. It seriously burdens
the usability of software under the Apache license; and it does so
without advancing the goals of the ASF.=20

Hmmm, I'd prefer to have it I think.

There are already many projects that use the Apache license verbatim 
instead of using it as a template.

Most of the people I pointed this out to, were not aware of this, so 
IMHO it's important that something like this is included (unless I have 
misunderstood the purpose or unless this phrase is not clear enough WRT 
this issue).

On the other hand, if people want to use this as a template, they will 
actually be modifying the license and thus cannot call it Apache License 
but Apache-like license for instance. In reality, everyone calls it 
Apache license nevertheless, indicating it as everything except the 
subjects, so there would be a terminology mismatch here.

Oh, the beauty of licenses 8-)

I certainly wouldn't want to have committed a copyright violation

I think the concern is whether the actual text has been modified, not 
whether another licensor has adopted the license for its use.  Perhaps 
the inverse of the second sentence proposed by Nathanael, so there's an 
obligation not to misrepresent the nature of the license rather than an 
affirmative duty to state "This isn't Apache."  This could read: "You 
may modify the text of this license document but you should not identify 
any such modified license as the 'Apache v.2.0 license.'" Or words to 
that effect.

 <the Proposed clause>
   8. Redistribution with Additional Terms.   You may choose to offer,
   and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity, or liability
   obligations and/or  other rights consistent  with the scope  of the
   license granted herein ("Additional Terms"). However, You may do so
   only on  Your own  behalf and as  Your sole responsibility,  not on
   behalf  of  any  other  Contributor,  and  only  if  You  agree  to
   indemnify,  defend, and  hold  every Contributor  harmless for  any
   liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
   by reason of any such Additional Terms.
 </proposed clause>

<suggested clause>

*. Accepting  warranty  or   Additional  liability.   You  may,  while
   redistributing  this   work  or  contributions,   with  or  without
   modifications,  choose  to  charge  a  fee  for  offering  support,
   warranty, indemnity,  or accept other  liability obligations and/or
   other  rights consistent with  the rights  hereby received  by you.
   However, in accepting such liability,  You may act only on Your own
   behalf and on  Your sole responsibility. Your actions  shall not be
   on  behalf  of any  other  Contributor.   You  agree to  indemnify,
   defend,  and  hold every  Contributor  harmless  for any  liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

(*)To be renumbered as para 11 - see below
</suggested clause>

Also, it is  a good idea if paragraphs 8 and  (10+11) as appearing and
in  the proposed  license are  swapped.   That is,  the permission  to
accept   further  liability   should  come   *after*   the  disclaimer
provisions.

Thus, instead of  the existing paragraphs 8, 9, 10,  11, it should
appear in the following order - 10, 11, 9, 8.

Thus,  my suggested paragraph  (above) should  be numbered  11 *after*
doing the renumbering.

The justification for this renumbering is that paragraph 8 as proposed
is  an  exception  to  the  disclaimer of  liability  of  distributors
(present 10 & 11). Logic requires that exceptions to general rules are
stated after the rule itself is stated.

Bit round about.

Why not:-

"... alleging that a the work, any contribution, any derivative of this
work which is licensed under these terms, or any part of these ...."
(constitutes direct or contributory ...etc )

I  have some problems  with these  wordings. What  exactly constitutes
"authorisation of the copyright owner"?

The suggestion,  if accepted,  would result in  putting the  burden of
verifying  that  every  contribution  is actually  authorised  by  the
copyright holder on the users / licensees.

Such verification  would be very difficult where  the copyright holder
is  a large  corporation  (like, ahem,  IBM)  because it  will not  be
difficult for a corporate to  turn around and say "we never authorised
that". The  outsider will be clueless  as to what exactly  the flow of
authority within a corporate entity is. 

OTOH, the word  "placed by the copyright owner"  in the official draft
is more appropriate, because the burden of proving that the person who
purportedly acted  on behalf  of the copyright  holder and  placed the
code under this license did not, in fact have the authority to do so.

What is the relevance of the word "fully paid up" appearing in 4(a)
of the proposed license?

To me, this would connote  a monetary transaction, whilea large number
of users  will get  the packages under  circumstances where,  no money
will actually change hands.

Perhaps section 5 could be reworked around the idea that "ALL patent
rights granted by this license will be revoked should ANY patent
infringement claim be made against ANY portion of this Work".

The authorization would be the license granted by the copyright owner to 
the entity placing the notice on the Work.  This license is either the 
Contributor license grant contained within Section 4 of the v.2.0 
license or a separate license agreement entered into between the 
copyright owner and the licensor.  In the vast majority of cases, in 
fact, the Licensor (e.g., ASF) will not be the copyright owner for the 
underlying code but is passing on a copyright license granted by other 
Contributors who have enabled the Licensor to do so.  Thus, I didn't 
believe it was accurate to state that the notice could only be "placed 
by the copyright owner."

Because the term "Contribution" means the original work of authorship 
and any additions or modifications that have been submitted to the 
Licensor for inclusion in the Work, the parenthetical was intended to 
clarify that those contributed modifications to the Work (and those 
only) are within the scope of the defensive termination.  Extending this 
clause to subsequent derivative works of the Work or a Contribution 
(_e.g._, modifications that a third party made on its own without 
submitting them to the licensor) would make the effect of this grant 
termination overly broad.

Agreed in concept.  That's what I was trying to accomplish with this 
proposed revision to Section 5 (which also corresponds to the defensive 
termination language in the proposed CLAs): 

    If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that a
    Contribution and/or the Work, without modification (other than
    modifications that are Contribution(s)), constitutes direct or
    contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
    to You under this License for that Contribution or such Work shall
    terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Patent infringement litigation involving a Contribution (a portion of 
the Work) or the Work itself would thus result in the termination of any 
patent licenses granted under the v.2.0 license.

Please be polite. If you are a member of that list and think this

http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2003/debian-legal-200311/msg00053.html 
includes the queries and comments from all the authors you mentioned.

Maybe *you* missed that this instruction was not clear in the 
announcement. It mentioned that the list exists (so what? We already 
have a good discussion list for this) and asks that ASF be told of 
concerns. It wasn't at all clear to me from the message that d-l 
subscribers were expected to use a different list for discussion, as 
long as someone let them know the outcomes. Ideally, that would be a 
maintainer affected by it, but I'll cc this to that list. Personally, 
I think it borders on discourteous to ask that we do not discuss it on 
our own list and join YAList.

Please cc me on discussion on that list, as I am not a subscriber.

Please investigate who applies the DFSG ("ftpmasters") and who they 
consult about them ("debian-legal consensus"). I suspect more than 
three individuals are reasonably happy with the statements on d-l, as 
you normally would see a lot of objections otherwise. The other 
possibility is that they don't care for Apache, but it's famous enough 
that I doubt it.

Why are you trying to combine patents and copyrights in the same 
licence? That's a minefield and a nuisance. Patent and copyright law 
are really quite different. Even in this country, where the same act 
encodes them, they do not really interact or have common parts. Can 
you publish an Apache Software Copyright Licence and an Apache 
Software Patent Licence?

That has not been the past interpretation of the DFSG. It is likely 
that any work able to include non-notice material in an unmodifiable 
notice file would be considered on a case-by-case basis. It would be 
better if we can avoid that possibility for software under Apache 
licences. Advertisements are not normally regarded as acceptable 
attribution statements.

Personally, I find your sample notice file for httpd 2.0 rather 
verbose. I'm not sure about the licences of all your contributing 
works and whether they require verbose forms, but is it not possible 
to use something more like this?

    Copyright 2003 The Apache Software Foundation

The PCRE one seems permitted by its licence at least ("like").

Are these licences also trying to be trademark licences? That explains 
the odd references to trade names in the sample notice file. Can't you 
publish and enforce Apache trademark licences instead of including 
trademark-related terms in copyright licences?

Isn't one of the maintainers of the Debian apache packages a member of 
ASF? Shouldn't you bring this up with him first? If you have, what has 
he said? I think it's rather ungrateful and unhelpful to criticised 
contributed work in public like this if you haven't discussed it with 
him. I find no messages from you on debian-apache or debian-legal 
about this problem. Maybe I am looking in the wrong place?

However, I think that misses the point. You actually seem to be 
annoyed by the analysis of your proposed licence against the DFSG. 
That seems very odd, as you requested analysis and comments. Did a 
debian-legal subscriber run over your cat? I do not understand why you 
are not open to discussion (even though d-l subscribers do tend to 
open with "I think this is a bug" rather than softer words) and claim 
to be a better applier of the DFSG than people who have done it many 
times before.

I am cross-posting this. Please do the same with replies.

First off, the GPL does have a patent grant in it. If you had a patent 
on GPL covered code and distributed it, that'd violate GPL 6.

Second, otherwise free code (e.g., BSD) isn't free if we can't use it 
according to the DFSG because of patent restrictions.

Please note that the DFSG doesn't say "copyright" anywhere. It applies 
to the total license. If a patent prevents us from doing things the 
DFSG demands, then it's not DFSG-free.

And without a patent grant, the work would not be free.

Its within the scope of DFSG 4 if it only has to be distributed with 
source, not binaries.

That depends. If an "advertisement" is just attribution --- e.g., a 
copyright statement --- then that'd probably be fine. If its an actual 
advertisement, like the type you see in the newspaper, then it wouldn't 
be.

Would you care to explain how they are?

All together, the message was 48K. That has nothing to do with 
freeness, of course.

The act of running the Program is not restricted by the proposed Apache
license either.  We don't need to list all of the things that are not
restricted by the license.

Again, you're subscribing to the world-view that the loss of an ability
for a patent-holder to enforce their patent is unquestionably a good
thing, in all circumstances.  Implementing this world-view is not a goal
of the 2.0 license effort, because we do not wish to force those entities
who do own patents to choose bwteen their ability to enforce their patents
and their ability to use Apache-licensed software.

Wait, I'm confused.  To fix ideas, suppose CorpA contributes code to httpd
which is covered under their PatentA.  CorpZ is a lawfirm that uses
httpd solely to manage and maintain their patent portfolio, and
decides to sue the ASF over a patent violation within httpd.  Do they
retain the right to continued use of httpd (i.e. is CorpA's patent
license to CorpZ revoked)?

Now what if CorpB distibutes a derivative version of httpd under the GPL
(assuming whatever license we adopt admits this), and CorpZ obtains
their httpd from CorpB.  Wouldn't Clause 0 of the GPL prevent CorpA
from revoking their patent license to CorpZ?  

In other words, to declare compatibility with the GPL, isn't it necessary
that CorpZ retains the right to continued use of the webserver, whether
or not they get it from CorpB or the ASF?

It seems to me that there are (at least) two situations:

  1) COMPANY uses SOFTWARE and HAS PATENT.  COMPANY
     has not contributed any code that involves
     PATENT.  Some other PARTY contributes CODE that
     infringes on PATENT, and so COMPANY sues PARTY
     for patent infringement.

  2) COMPANY uses SOFTWARE and HAS PATENT.  COMPANY
     contributes CODE that involves PATENT, and
     subsequently sues based upon CODE.

What is intended to be covered by the clause?

In this scenario, because COMPANY (the end-user of the SOFTWARE) has 
instituted patent litigation against PARTY alleging that a Contribution 
constitutes patent infringement, any patent licenses granted to COMPANY 
under the License for the CODE making up that Contribution (by PARTY or 
otherwise) are terminated.

These facts don't provide enough information to determine the outcome of 
the scenario.   COMPANY appears to be suing an unknown entity for patent 
infringement based on its own Contribution.  To the extent that you are 
concerned that COMPANY's suit would mean the outright removal of 
COMPANY's PATENT from the License, that would not be the case here 
because the defensive termination language only affects patent licenses 
granted to the party bringing suit.  Clearly COMPANY cannot lose the 
right to its own patent..

Essentially, Scenario 1.  If an end-user sues anyone else on the grounds 
that a Contribution or the Work infringes its patent, the end-user loses 
any patent licenses granted to it under the v.2.0 license for the 
Contribution or Work.  This does not mean that the end-user can no 
longer use that code, only that it now does so in the absence of such a 
patent grant.

Subject: FSF Comments on ASL 2.0 draft
From: Eben Moglen <moglen@columbia.edu>
X-Spam-Rating: daedalus.apache.org 1.6.2 0/1000/N
X-Spam-Rating: minotaur-2.apache.org 1.6.2 0/1000/N

On behalf of the Free Software Foundation, I wish to submit comments
on two aspects of ASL 2.0.

First, with respect to Section 3.C:

      C. A Contribution is "submitted" when any form of electronic,
      verbal, or written communication is sent to the Licensor,
      including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
      lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
      that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose
      of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
      that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by
      the Contributor as "Not a Contribution."

We believe that the intention here is to indicate that in order for
any modification of code under the license to be a Contribution, it
must be intentionally submitted to the Licensor.  A patch put on an
FTP server or the public Web, and then either picked up directly by
the Licensor or forwarded by a third party, does not seem to be a
Contribution within the intended meaning of the clause.  But as the
language stands, only the act of marking all such publicly-available
mods "Not a Contribution" ensures that such code is, indeed, not
treated as a "Contribution."  FSF believes that the phrase "sent to
the Licensor" should be modified to read "intentionally sent to the
Licensor by its copyright holder" to clarify that intention, and to
prevent parties who make publicly accessible their patches and
improvements from having to mark "Not a Contribution" on every copy
they distribute or make publicly accessible.

Second, with respect to section 5:

FSF, having long warned against the dangers of software patents,
entirely shares the goal of providing protection against inappropriate
and destructive uses of patent claims to interfere with software
freedom.  The Foundation expects version 3 of the GPL to incorporate
one or more license provisions designed to increase the collective
defense against patent abuse.  The two provisions contained in section
5, however, embody two quite different theories of response.

It is evident that an implicit patent grant to make, use and sell
follows necessarily if the licensor of free software has patent claims
that read on the software it distributes under a free license.  FSF
believes that it is appropriate to make that implicit grant explicit,
to increase the certainty of freedom, and to eliminate a potential
source of conflict between licensors and licensees over the scope of
the grant.  When a free software program's copyright licensee chooses
to assert patent claims that would in turn decrease the freedom of the
work it has licensed, FSF believes that it may well be appropriate for
such an explicit patent license accompanying the free software
copyright license to terminate.  Thus the second sentence of proposed
section 5 embodies a form of patent defense that FSF considers a
candidate for use in its own future free software licenses,
particularly version 3 of the GNU GPL.  

The broad general termination provision contained in the first
sentence of section 5, however, raises much more serious problems.

      If You institute patent litigation against a
      Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software
      (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any
      patent licenses granted by that Contributor to You under this
      License shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

The phrase "a patent applicable to software" includes patents whose
claims may potentially read on software even if the mode of practicing
the claims disclosed by the patent involved exclusively non-software
contexts, and even if the form of infringement being claimed in the
litigation initiated has nothing to do with software.  This is, in
FSF's view, undoubtedly overbroad.

Failure to distinguish between offensive and defensive use of patent
claims means that A, vexatiously or frivolously sued by company B for
patent infringement or on some other ground, may be inhibited in
bringing forward legitimate claims of patent infringement against B,
lest it by doing so lose the benefit of a existing patent grant from C
it gained as a user of free software that has nothing whatever to do
with the dispute between A and B.  Such a situation is particularly
troublesome where A is in no way acting to threaten the freedom of
free software, but B *is* doing so (perhaps, for example, by bringing
not patent claims but trade secret and contractual claims against A
with the specific intent of harming the freedom of free software), and
A's defensive assertion of patent claims results from patents
"applicable to software" but not presently being applied to software.
C, a licensor under ASL, then strategically acts to terminate A's
right to use free software under section 5, in order to help B achieve
an inappropriate leverage in its dispute with A.  In such a situation,
far from protecting the freedom of free software against bad software
patents, the first sentence of section 5 has threatened the freedom of
free software by enabling strategic advantage to be taken in a dispute
that didn't even involve a software patent in the first place.

For this and other reasons, FSF believes that broad automatic
termination provisions like that contained in the first sentence of
section 5 are fraught with potentially serious unintended
consequences, and are not an appropriate vehicle for protecting the
freedom of free software against the serious threat posed by software
patent litigation.  We would urge that the first sentence of section 5
be removed.  Additional protection against patent abuse beyond that
contained in the second sentence of section 5 may well be necessary;
FSF continues to review possible approaches for inclusion in GPL 3,
but we believe that, at a minimum, distinctions between offensive and
defensive use, and between patent abuses that threaten the freedom of
free software and those that don't, need to be reflected in whatever
provisions are adopted.

FSF notes that section 5 is the only element of ASL 2.0 that is
incompatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.  FSF
continues to believe that the achievement of compatibility between ASL
and GPL would be of enormous benefit to the community of free software
developers, allowing merger of valuable code bases currently
separated by license incompatibilities.  FSF is pleased to note the
convergence implied by the ASL 2.0 draft.  FSF will make efforts, in
the development, discussion, and adoption of GPL 3 to further the
process of convergence, by carefully considering the Apache
Foundation's approach to the patent defense problem.  For this reason,
we consider the distinction between the approaches contained in the
first and second sentences of section 5 to be particularly
significant.

Respectfully submitted.

Let us say that IBM is using an Apache WORK.  Let us further assume IBM
might have a patent on something that they choose not to contribute to the
WORK.  Finally, let us stipulate that there are other patents involved in
the WORK from other parties.  If someone else were to implement IBM's patent
in code and contribute it to the WORK that IBM uses as a basis for their own
product containing their patent, are you saying that if IBM were to sue to
protect their own patent, that they would lose any patent licenses granted
to IBM through Apache License v2?

I'm sorry.  That wasn't intentional.  I was trying to posit a situation
wherein someone makes a "poisoned contribution": a contribution containing
code for which they have filed a patent, with the expectation that there
will be a dependence upon that technology by the time they are granted the
patent, thus allowing them to claim that the code contains their licensable
technology.  At least that was how I understood a concern mentioned earlier
on the list.

Doesn't that last sentence translate into illegal use, unless they acquire
the necessary patent license(s) via other means?

If IBM decides to sue someone else on the ground that a Contribution 
constitutes patent infringement, then under the proposed language IBM 
would in fact lose any patent license granted under this License to that 
Contribution.  In the facts you provide, it would appear that the 
infringing party would not have an enforceable patent to the code, but 
to the extent they did, the related patent license grant would 
terminate.  If the basis for IBM's suit were that the Contribution in 
combination with the Work or the Work itself constituted patent 
infringement, then IBM would lose any patent license granted under the 
License to the whole of the Work, including the Contribution.  Of 
course, the converse of this is that the clause allows the party being 
sued (the Contributor) to assert any patent rights it may hold in 
defense of the suit, so it is not left in the position of having given 
an irrevocable patent grant to the plaintiff and thus a significantly 
weakened ability to refute such infringement claims.

The copyright license grant is not affected by the termination of the 
patent license, and the end-user has the same ability to use the 
software (legitimately or otherwise) as if the patent license had never 
been granted.  Further, as in the hypothetical you describe above, there 
may have been no legitimate patent that could have been enforced by the 
Contributor, or the patent in question could be invalid.  So, use itself 
would not necessarily be "illegal" simply because of the loss of this 
precise patent grant.

So if the plaintiff's claim is only against a contribution, not the WORK,
the only patent license grant(s) lost would be related to the specific
contribution in question, not those provided with the WORK as a whole?  My
understanding was that all patent license grants associated with the WORK
were lost.  That also seemed to be underlying the concern from the FSF,
although I might be misunderstanding, or perhaps I need to re-read your
modifications.

Because in this case, the collective is part of the basis, rather than a
separable piece?

Sorry to restate this; I'm just trying to understand.  Thank you for taking
the time to explain.

It was my understanding that the Apache upstream developers had always
been aware of how Debian managed its packages of Apache, and (at worst)
tolerated it.  If that is not the case, can you describe the nature of
your recent communications with our Apache package maintainers, and
whether you feel your concerns have been adequately addressed by them?

It is worth noting that our previous Apache package maintainer is no
longer active with the Debian Project, and that for some time after his
departure, the Apache packages languished a little without fully
attentive maintenance.  However, it's my understanding that this has not
been the case now for several months (at least).

I am confident that if your concerns with Debian's compliance with the
terms of the Apache Software License are clearly articulated (perhaps in
a new thread on the debian-legal mailing list), we will be able to
rectify the situation.

I will not comment on the remainder of your message except to observe
that it is the Debian Project's prerogative and responsibility to
interpret the "Debian Free Software Guidelines".  That said, our
license-vetting process is completely public, and open to participation
by anyone who is interested.  One need not be a Debian Developer to to
make cogent arguments and be taken seriously.  If you feel that the
Debian Project is institutionally drifting away from interpretations of
the DFSG that are advantageous to your organization, you are perfectly
welcome to join our mailing list, or appoint a delegate to do so, and
attempt to influence our deliberations accordingly.  You may have
perspectives to share that have been under-represented to date.

Yes, if the claim states only that the Contribution constitutes patent 
infringement, then only patent licenses granted to the end-user under 
the License for that Contribution terminate.  Of course, this has the 
effect of eliminating a patent license grant to a portion of the Work, 
if the Contribution had been submitted to the Work for inclusion and was 
in fact incorporated.  As I read the feedback from FSF,  their concern 
with the original Section 5 dwelt primarily with the first sentence that 
covered all "patents applicable to software."  This sentence is also 
absent from my proposal.  Eben articulated an excellent analysis 
regarding the difference between the offensive and defensive use of 
patents, noting that he hoped to maintain a distinction between "patent 
abuses that threaten the freedom of free software and those that 
don't."  My recommended approach is tailored to confine the defensive 
termination to situations only involving the software actually licensed 
under this License.

Not at all, it's worthwhile to delve into this.  Hope to meet you "live" 
at ApacheCon.  "Contribution" is defined as the original work of 
authorship or any additions or modifications submitted for that 
inclusion to that Work (with "Work" being defined simply as the work of 
authorship to which this License is attached).  Thus, if someone alleged 
that an entire Work constituted patent infringement, that party would 
lose any and all patent licenses granted to it under the License for 
that Work, which would include the individual patent licenses granted by 
the Contributors under Section 4 for their Contributions that had been 
submitted for inclusion in that Work..  Note the corresponding language 
in the proposed Contributor License Agreement, which states: "Your [the 
Contributor] patent grant shall terminate with respect to any party that 
institutes patent litigation against you (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the work 
to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement, as of the date such litigation is filed."

Jennifer,

Can you please explain how one is to pull that out of the language:

>    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that a
>    Contribution and/or the Work, without modification (other than

Are you saying that as a matter of legal interpretation, it is understood
that

  a Contribution      and/or            the Work
  that Contribution   or                such Work

is a set of bound pairings?  I would have read the language differently, and
I suspect that most lay people would, so this could be an important point to
clarify to non-lawyers.

Yes, he did.  His analysis was one of the first things I have seen in a very
long time that prompted me to actually consider rendering a chart of logic
and relationships.

Yes, I had understood that you were narrowing the effect of it.  What I did
not understand was how precisely you had narrowed it, if my new
understanding as described above is correct.

> it's worthwhile to delve into this.  Hope to meet you "live" at ApacheCon.

Sorry, no.  I won't be there this year, which I consider a mistake on my
part.  Will plan to attend the next one, and hopefully speak at it.
Meanwhile, I asked Ken to say "Hi" to you from me.  I've a friend opening an
authentic Greek restaurant in the Raleigh area, so perhaps I'll get up there
when it opens.

Not so.  I regard any attempt to shut down or hamper an open source =
software project by enforcing a patent against it as a bad thing, and so =
would view anything that would prevent that as a good thing.  Hence my =
advocacy of some kind of mutual defence for OSS.

I think that most of the time, on balance, the patent system benefits =
humanity.  Software patents are less defensible, but I think that =
commercial software vendors are capable of looking after themselves.

Therefore I want to see some kind of mutual defence against patent =
lawsuits within the open source community.  I certainly do not want to =
see anything that would hamper a patent holder's ability to enforce =
their patent against the rest of the world.

Open source developers are a community that extends beyond individual =
projects.  You might say that the Apache project has no business helping =
other OSS projects to defend themselves against patent lawsuits, and =
that is entirely your perogative.  But I must respectfully disagree.

Paul.

It is if your patent license is revoked.

Software that is licensed to you under the GPL, for which you 
subsequently use in a patent-infringing way, is no different
in this regard.  You are not free use GPL software to violate 
the law, not even if you refuse to accept its terms.

My interpretation of the FSF's comments on the license@ list
are that, in their view, a GPL-v2 licensor _implicitly_ 
forfeits any patent claims that would apply to the licensed
software.  However, that fact alone does not imply the proposed
license is _incompatible_ with the GPL-v2: an author of a 
derivative work may be willing to forfeit such patent claims
without insisting that the authors of the original work forfeit
theirs also.

FWIW, I personally don't give a damn about the ASF adopting a 
license which does not _guarantee_ DFSG-freeness.  However, I 
do care if it the license makes it impossible to comply, and 
I find comments along those lines to be far more persuasive.

Hi all,

you can find my comments below the text of the license sections I 
commented on.

    =====================================================================
    ==  DO NOT PANIC!  This is a draft for discussion purposes only.   ==
    ==  It has not yet been approved. It does not yet apply to any     ==
    ==  software distributed by the Apache Software Foundation.        ==
    ==                                                                 ==

    ==================================+==================================

                              Apache TCK License
                          Version 1.0, October 2003
                       http://www.apache.org/licenses/

             Copyright (C) 2003  The Apache Software Foundation.
          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
          of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
            FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

    1. Licensing the Work.

       A. These terms and conditions for use, reproduction, distribution,
       and modification (the "License") apply to any original work of
       authorship (the "Work") containing a notice placed by the
       copyright owner (the "Licensor") indicating that the Work is
       licensed under the Apache TCK License, Version 1.0.

       B. The Work is distributed by the Licensor as a Technology
       Compatibility Kit (TCK), the suite of tests, tools, and
       documentation that allows an implementor of a Specification to
       determine if their implementation is compliant with that
       Specification, where the Specification is a current or proposed
       industry standard defined by one or more documents listed within

I think "industry standard" is a little far fetched, unless Apache Software
Foundation starts providing TCKs for standards proposed by
standardization bodies. Sun's desire to promote their APIs as an "industry
standard", a meaningless term unless we are talking about ISO, ECMA or
ANSI, shouldn't result in marketing speak polluting the license.

       the license notice; each such Specification is identified by
       title, revision label (or date if no label has been assigned),
       and Uniform Resource Identifier.

    2. You. "You" or "Your" means an individual or legal entity
       exercising permissions granted by this License. By exercising any
       of the permissions granted to You in Sections 4 through 9 herein,
       You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms
       and conditions.

    3. Contributors and Contributions.

       A. The Licensor and any individual or legal entity that
       voluntarily submits to the Licensor a Contribution to the Work are
       collectively addressed herein as "Contributors". For legal
       entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities
       that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with
       that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the
       purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct
       or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
       whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
       percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or
       (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

Beside the obvious philosophical dicussion about how much in charge a
person is about their actions ("The devil made me contribute!"), this
paragraph's vague definition of control under (1) doesn't seem to make
much sense. I can make someone read this comment by posting it to the
mailing list, therefore I'm in control of that person because I
used my indirect power to directed the person to read using
"otherwise" means aka as posting? ASF, all your code belongs to me ;)

It's not obvious why that piece of legalese is in the license.

       B. A "Contribution" is the original version of the Work and any
       modification or addition to the Work that has been submitted for
       inclusion in the Work, where such modifications and/or additions
       to the Work originate from that particular Contributor, or from
       some entity acting on behalf of that Contributor.

       C. A Contribution is "submitted" when any form of electronic,
       verbal, or written communication is sent to the Licensor,
       including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
       lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
       that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose
       of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
       that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by
       the Contributor as "Not a Contribution."

How does one designate verbal communication in writing? An attempt to
be overly broad, yet so limited. Basically, anything you tell us
belongs to us, nyah nyah nyah.

There are situations imaginable where I could tell ASF about A, but
would have no right to contribute A to the ASF without being the
copyright holder. The 'ours by default' claim hidden in this license
may get in you trouble when you get lax on checking if people are
actually allowed to contribute the content of the conversation.

Example: During the discussion of a TCK test someone brings up an
excerpt from a regression test in Kaffe's regression test suite. ASF
can according to their license claim it as a contribution, and add it
to their TCK. If the TCK license turns out to be GPL incompatible, who
do I sue for copyright infringement: the ASF for violating the license
of my code, or the person that cited the code on an ASF mailing list?

       D. Any Contribution submitted by You to the Licensor shall be
       under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
       additional terms or conditions, unless You explicitly state
       otherwise in the submission.

    4. Contributor Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions
       of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You:

       (a) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty
           free, irrevocable copyright license under its licensable
           copyrights in the Work to reproduce, prepare derivative works
           of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
           distribute the Work and such derivative works; and,

       (b) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty
           free, irrevocable (subject to Section 5) patent license to
           make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
           otherwise transfer the Work and derivative works thereof,
           where such license applies only to those patent claims
           licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed
           by their Contribution alone or by combination of their
           Contribution with the Work to which such Contribution was
           submitted by the Contributor.

       No assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Work does
       not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of
       any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to You
       for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
       intellectual property rights or otherwise. You assume sole
       responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
       needed, if any.

    5. Reciprocity. If You institute patent litigation against a
       Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software
       (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any
       patent licenses granted by that Contributor to You under this
       License shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
       In addition, if You institute patent litigation against any entity
       (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
       that the Work itself (excluding combinations of the Work with
       other software or hardware) infringes Your patent(s), then any
       patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
       shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    6. Redistribution without Modification. You may reproduce and
       distribute verbatim copies of the Work as You received it, in any
       medium, provided that You conspicuously publish on each copy an
       appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, keep
       intact all of the notices that refer to this License and to the
       absence of any warranty, and give any other recipients of the Work
       a copy of this License along with the Work.

    7. Redistribution with Modification. You may modify Your copy or
       copies of the Work or any portion of it, thus forming another work
       product based on the Work (a "Derivative Work"), and reproduce and
       distribute such modifications or the Derivative Work, provided
       that You also meet the following conditions:

       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Derivative Work a
           copy of this License along with the Derivative Work.

       (b) You must retain, in the source code of any Derivative Work
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, or trademark
           notices from the source code of the Work, excluding those
           notices that only pertain to portions of the Work that have
           been excluded from the Derivative Work. If the Work includes a
           "NOTICE" file as part of its source code distribution, the
           Derivative Work must include a readable copy of the notices
           contained within that NOTICE file, excluding those notices
           that only pertain to portions of the Work that have been
           excluded from the Derivative Work, in at least one of the
           following places: within a NOTICE file distributed as part of
           the Derivative Work; within the source code or documentation,
           if provided along with the Derivative Work; or, within a
           display generated by the Derivative Work, if and wherever such
           third-party notices normally appear. You may add Your own
           notices alongside or as an addendum to the original NOTICE
           information. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
           informational purposes only and do not modify the terms and
           conditions of this License.

       (c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files.

       (d) You must do one of the following:

           (1) remove from the Derived Work all tests that are specific
               to features of the Specification and all documentation
               describing the Specification and those specific tests; or

           (2) cause the Derived Work to be clearly and conspicuously
               labeled as "not the official TCK for the Specification"
               and "for research purposes only", and clearly and
               conspicuously identify within the documentation and
               packaging of the Derived Work that it is not the official
               TCK for the Specification, and further that passing the
               tests in the Derived Work does not indicate that an
               implementation has passed the TCK for the Specification.

I am not sure I parse that correctly: does that mean I can do (1) such
that I take a TCK, remove everything that refers to the specification,
and redistribute it as "The real TCK" without any labelling? Cute.

The restrictions on the labeling may make the TCK license GPL
incompatible. Other restrictions, like the clause that only if you pass 
the original TCK you can say that you passed it, may give the original 
contributor a lot of power to close out competing implementations by 
including references to code outside the specification in the TCK.

Example: If A wanted to make sure their competition wouldn't be able to 
pass a TCK, all they need to do would be to put in a test case that 
links to some internal, unspecified class from their implementation (say 
an com.a.internal.* class).  I see no protection against the licensee 
using the TCK as a means to prevent competition instead of encouraging 
it in the proposed license.

The license should in my opinion require that the code covered by it is 
always completely runnable and buildable within the specified framework, 
or referenced frameworks within the specification, or with code provided 
  alongside the TCK under a compatible license.

cheers,

The scope of this license is very clear, at the top:

    ==  This TCK version is for use by JSR-defined projects releasing  ==
    ==  an official TCK for a JSR under JSPA 2.5.                      ==

It's not intended to be applicable to any other standards effort.  The
people from Apache have been involved in the Java Community Process on the
premise that we can drag this community, kicking and screaming if need be,
into being a real multilateral standards effort.  We are not alone in that
goal, and even within Sun there are people who want to do "the right
thing" in this regard.  If you don't agree with this premise, then just
ignore this license, it has no bearing on projects that are not JCP TCKs.

This is the same language as in the 2.0 license, by the way, as is the
rest of your comments.

Consider the situation where company A wishes to insert a submarine patent
into an Apache project.  They form a small company, company B, and have it
write the patent-infringing code, and then donate that code to the
organization.  They then disband company B, and start to pursue legal
claims against the ASF and/or its others based on the code contributed by
Company B.  Our ability to pass liability for that through to the original
Contributor is really difficult when that Contributor is defunct.
Therefore, language like this helps make it clear that playing a game like
that won't work.

You're missing the "conspicuously marked", which could apply to verbal
communication.

You're also exaggerating the claim.  It doesn't "belong to us", we get the
non-exclusive right to redistribute it on our terms.  And yes, if someone
tells us something, whether verbal or otherwise, we want that right to
incorporate it into Apache code, unless that person clearly says we can't.

Simply telling us "about" A isn't what we're concerned about.  Telling us
"this is how some other project implements A" doesn't give us all rights
to A, either.  Nothing in the license suggests this.  It means that, if A
is a derivative of the licensed code, any IP ownership *you* have in A,
you are granting us the right to redistribute.

That would only be true *if*

  the person who posted the test case to the list was the copyright
    holder, or otherwise had the necessary rights to be able to contribute
    it to the ASF, and
  it was a derivative work from Apache-2.0-licensed code.

In your example, it sounds like neither would be the case.  The Apache 2.0
license does *not* mean that suddenly anything posted to an Apache
development list is "borg"ed into being a contribution to the ASF.

Well, you can call it "the real TCK", and without being able to claim
which standard it is a TCK for, it's pretty useless.  Why would you want
to do that?

It is not a goal for the TCK license to be GPL compatible.  We know it
can't be - the concept of testing for conformance is contrary to the goals
of the GPL.

This license is not intended to allow derivative works to claim to
be TCKs for a given specification.

Your example is somewhat bogus - a TCK for a standard that tests for
classes outside that namespace would not be acceptable to Apache.  It
would be a broken project.  Because the source code is published, it's
easy to find such bogusness.

What problem exists without these requirements?

Hi Brian,

thanks for your quick reply. You've cleared up my mistakes in 
interpretation quite nicely ;)

I'm not saying tests, I'm saying "links to", i.e. uses classes outside 
of the namespace. It obviously has to for TCKs outside the java.lang 
namespace in order to include java.lang.Object. ;)

It may be possible to publish a TCK that requires a third party 
component to run which is either unspecified, so that it can not be 
recreated freely (a sun.* class, for example), or encumbered by a 
non-free/non-ASL2-compatible license.

The situation I'm afraid of is the following: you get the TCK, but can't 
use it to create a free, competing implementation of the specification 
because a contributor sneaked in a reference to a some unacessible code 
into the spec. What matters to me is that the TCK allows creation of 
competing, spec-compliant implementations without imposing restrictions 
that can not be fulfilled by the free software community/independant 
efforts outside the JCP, like 'here's the TCK but you need this 
TCKrunner software to run the tests, which is only available under 'some 
non-ASL2-compatible' license'.

I've never seen any TCK code, so I don't know how it all works, and a 
lot of this is speculation. But seeing how you've tried to address many 
ways of trying to hijack your code, I'm wondering whether you think my 
concerns are valid or not.

thanks again for taking the time to reply,

Which fight are we talking about here?

The fight against patents is certainly Apache's fight.  Their strategy
(require a patent grant for all contributions) seems like a potentially
useful way to fight back.  The patent grant (4b) seems to be the key part
of this strategy.  Other than the mixing of patent and copyright, it
seems few people have issues with it.

I'm not sure if there's a separate "fight" behind the reciprocity clause
(#5).  Is it there as another defense mechanism, or is it there to make
4b more palatable to patent holders?

The freedom to worry is also unrestricted under the proposed license,
although if anything is to be gleaned from the SCO circus, it's that
just about anybody can make shit up and threaten the freedom to 
use/copy/modify what was ostensibly free software.  However, the "fair
use" provisions of copyright law, as applied to software, may provide
sufficient defense for us poor Linux users should SCO actually come 
after us.

Note that Section 4(a) of the proposed license says your copyright
license is absolutely irrevocable, so it does give you a viable
means of defense against an infringement suit from a contributor.
I would imagine that clause [1] is a large reason why the FSF 
characterized the IBM Public License as a free license [2].

"GPL compatibility" has a very specific meaning, which AFAICT 
is entirely unrelated to the situation you offer; see

  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean

Since the proposed license has a better definition of "Contribution",
one GPL-incompatibility mentioned by the FSF (wrt the IBM license) is 
eliminated.  There appear to be others [3], especially related to the
first sentence of Section 5, but I'm optimistic that they can be fixed
without too much fuss.

If that's all it did, I'd be fine with it.  However, I don't like the
side-effect of making Apache users defenseless against unrelated
software patent attacks from Apache contributors.

I believe Arnoud Engelfriet mentioned that this clause (#5) has been
removed from the draft.  I havn't checked.  If so, that's good; this
is clearly the most problematic clause.

Jennifer Machovec, who's drafting the license, posted a new
version to license@apache.org on November 13. You can read it at
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=license@apache.org&msgNo=24

It actually has two versions; the first was supposed to be
a redlined version but that has been stripped out by the
mailing list archive. The 'clean' version is at about 2/3rds
of the page.

OK, I understand.  I still think that the normal processes by which the
code is developed at Apache (or any other open source project) would be
able to identify such mistakes (intentional or otherwise) and call them
out as bugs needing to be fixed.  Much more so than the current situation,
where TCKs are created by a single company and often not available in
source code form.

I think the same answer applies here, though there's no guarantee anyways
that non-free software would be required.  E.g., there could be a JSR A
that depends on another JSR B, and JSR B might not have an open source
implementation.  That doesn't mean the implementation of JSR A is useless.
Clearly, as said before, any "hidden" requirements would be clearly
brought to light.

If there's a defect in the spec, then the proper place to address that is
within the JSR specification process.

I think your concerns are valid, but I think there are places other than
the TCK license requirements where those concerns can and would be
addressed.

The fact that the license can be revoked over unrelated squabbles
between users and authors appears to be an attempt to make software
patents impractical and useless.  If it only made software patents *on
Apache* useless (the second clause of S5), I'd think it reasonable.
That would parallel what the GNU GPL does for copyrights for example.
What's currently there attempts to use the usefulness of Apache to buy
non-enforcement of software patents elsewhere, which I believe is
inappropriate for Free Software.

Correction: Jennifer Machovec is not drafting the license.  She is an
attorney at IBM who submitted comments on behalf of IBM.

I am drafting the license on behalf of the ASF.  I will most likely
include the changes that IBM suggested, assuming that there aren't
any more objections.  We've already gone through several iterations
on the patent sentences, mostly to deal with derivative work, so it
isn't too surprising that we need to scale it back again.

FYI, prior to a couple months ago, Drew Wright was representing IBM
and made many suggestions to improve the license.  I have also had
discussions with folks from Apple, Sun, Mozilla, OSI, FSF, and a few
independent attorneys.  The hope is that the license will be reviewed
by all of the companies that use Apache software, since that is less
expensive than us hiring a couple thousand IP lawyers.

Uhm, if the current license draft gets adopted, I would
expect that the number of binary distribution questions
will explode rather than decrease.

Deciphering the meaning of 7b is a nightmare at best.
One sentence in this monster paragraph goes over 11 lines!!

As a programmer, I'm most interested what the license 
says about derivative work. For me, there are only
3 "spiritual" filing cabinets: BSD, GPL, LGPL. Any 
additional license conditions on top of those can 
usually easily be accommodated (from a programming
point of view).

Up to now, Apache's license was clearly of BSDish
character. Reading through the new one, that clarity
regarding derivative works is gone.

After reading multiple times through point 7, my 
best guess is that the new license still allows binary
derivative works without the contribution of modifications
but I'm far from sure about this.

best regards,

Hello,

Looking at the October 2003 draft of the Apache License, Version 2.0 
("AL2") I have a few queries/observations I'd like to share regarding 
Section 7.

 > 7. Redistribution with Modification. You may modify Your copy or
 >    copies of the Work or any portion of it, thus forming another work
 >    product based on the Work (a "Derivative Work"), and reproduce and
 >    distribute such modifications or the Derivative Work, provided

 >        copy of this License along with the Derivative Work.

So far so good...

 >    (b) You must retain, in the source code of any Derivative Work
 >        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, or trademark
 >        notices from the source code of the Work, excluding those

 >        that only pertain to portions of the Work that have been

 >        following places: within a NOTICE file distributed as part of

 >        third-party notices normally appear. You may add Your own
 >        notices alongside or as an addendum to the original NOTICE
 >        information. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
 >        informational purposes only and do not modify the terms and

Version 1.1 of the Apache Software License makes it very clear that a 
derivative work can be distributed in either source or binary form.  I 
believe Section 5 still allows closed source derivatives, though it 
doesn't specifically state this; I fear it may actually /increase/ the 
number of "can I include X in my commercial product"-type questions.

I note that with a BSD-ish template-type licence, including the 1.x 
Apache Software License, the name of the copyright holder is part of the 
licence and hence will be included alongside any binary derivative. 
This would appear not to be the case in binary derivatives licensed 
under AL2; only the AL2 licence itself and the NOTICEs, if any, would 
need to be reproduced.  Details of the copyright owner of an AL2'd work 
could be lost if not included as a NOTICE.  This may not be a cause of 
concern but I thought it was worth noting anyway.

 >    (c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 >        stating that You changed the files.

This is a cause of confusion for me, to be honest.  It seems perfectly 
clear in the case of source files, but how can I do it for binary 
executables and library files, for .class or .jar files?  If this should 
only apply to source files, could this be stated?

I hope these comments are genuinely useful; for what it's worth in 
general I think the new licence is very good.  (I am not a lawyer.)

All the best,

Dave

P.S. Section 4 grants a "worldwide" licence to use; can I assume it also 
applies to /off-planet/ usage?  ;o)

Yes, that follows quite clearly.  People don't share your opinion, so
resort to hysterically absurd arguments.

That the GNU FDL is not DFSG-free tells us nothing about the
DFSG-freeness of *any* other license.

I entirely agree.  It's not always easy to perform this sort of
analysis, and we may be tricked from time to time through secret
conspiracies between separate organizations, one of whom holds a
copyright and the other who holds a patent implemented by the
copyrighted code.

It would not have been fair to penalize the authors of the GIMP for the
hostile and malicious actions of Unisys regarding the LZW patent, so we
did not.

The case where the same organization holds a copyright and an applicable
patent is a no-brainer, though.  Both the patent and the copyright
licenses must satisfy the DFSG, and furthermore, any subsequent transfer
of either or both the copyright or patent to other parties must be
closely scrunitized.  As a rule of thumb, I'd say any such transfer
should not be regarded as materially affecting the situation.

A hypothetical:

If Microsoft had a patent (free for use in "web browsers only") on HTTP
and had licensed Internet Explorer under the GNU GPL, IE would have to
go in non-free.  If they then sold their patent to IBM, the situation
would not change unless IBM then went and made the patent license fully
DFSG-free.  After all, we really have no way of knowing whether would
Microsoft offered the HTTP patent to IBM for a steeply discounted price
if IBM would agree to never relax the license terms on the patent.  From
what I recall of the Microsoft federal antitrust suit in the U.S., this
sort of arrangment would be entirely within Microsoft's character.

If a single organization (or multiple organizations when there is reason
to believe collusion has taken place) asserts non-free copyright or
patent licenses applicable to the same work, then the copyrighted
implementation must be regarded as permanently tainted until both the
copyright and patent license are made unambiguously DFSG-free.

Organizations need to pay more than just lip service to freedom for us
to recognize their participation in the Free Software community.
Freedom which you cannot exercise is not freedom at all, and those
responsible for preventing the exercise of freedom must be held to
account.

(Yes, I've been reading Chomsky lately.  Does it show? :) )

*shrug* That's not our problem.

President Bush considers a "missile defense shield" a vitally important
military defense strategy.  That doesn't mean he's right, or that he
deserves our support.

Well, I think it's probably intended more as a technique to force the
dispute out of the courts and into settlement.

Maybe that's what you mean.

Given the general impression of the USPTO over the past decade or so, it
may be that a significant number of patents in the U.S. would be
invalidated if they were ever brought to litigation.

In which case, the reciprocity clause actually strengthens the existing
broken patent regime by preventing bullshit software patents[1] from
being litigated at all, rather than promoting the development of a
"pool" of patents available to the Free Software community (or any other
supposedly "benevolent" purpose).

I'd sure like to know what Eben Moglen thinks about this issue.

[1] This phrase may be redundant.

(modified repost, some answers figured out already)

Hi all!

I have some questions after reading

http://www.apache.org/licenses/proposed/

...my guess is that they'll all be FAQs...

Goals
-----
 > 4. Compatible with other licenses

Q: The big question of course: is this new license LPGL and/or 
GPL-compatible? Has the FSF been asked to comment on that yet? Have they 
made any kind of statement? Will there be?

A: Eben Moglen has submitted some comments on the draft on behalf of the 
FSF. The FSF believes the current section 5 is incompatible with the 
GPL, but there is some work being done on that section so that might be 
fixed. Furthermore, they've indicated they'll be taking (further) 
compatibility between ASL and GPL into account while drafting GPL 
version 3. The complete message is at:

http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=license@apache.org&msgNo=69

Q: Is this license DFSG-free? (DFSG being the Debian Free Software 
Guidelines)

A: some people seem to think so, others do not. The problematic clause 
is again #5; the reworked clause will probably remove most objections 
that were raised on the debian-legal mailing list.

Q: Is the license OSI-certified?

A: obviously, still being a draft, it isn't yet. It is likely it will 
be, though.

License
-------
 >   4. Contributor Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions
 >      of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You:

Q: IIUC, the current license is an agreement between the ASF and "the 
rest of the world". This seems like an agreement between Contributors 
and "the rest of the world". Doesn't that affect the ability of the ASF 
to protect its members from being sued? If so, how?

A: none yet.

 >     C. A Contribution is "submitted" when any form of electronic,
 >     verbal, or written communication is sent to the Licensor,
 >     including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
 >     lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
 >     that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose
 >     of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
 >     that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by
 >     the Contributor as "Not a Contribution."

Q: I wonder...what if a contributor sends a patch to a committer via 
private e-mail, or posts it in a comment on a weblog, or something 
similar? Does this clause mean that we should be avoiding such things?

A: yes.

 >      (c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 >          stating that You changed the files.

Q: IIUC this means that if you fork source code and change it, there 
should be a statement like "This file modified by Bla-Blah, Inc. from 
the ASF ones". Perhaps it would be good to have an example of a 
"prominent notice" in the appendix?

A: none yet.

Q: Also, does this mean that any change committed to the ASF CVS must 
include notices like this? That seems like a nightmare to ensure!

A: yes, it does.

Q: Would a cvs-generated changelog be appropriate?

A: none yet.

 >     You may add Your own copyright statement to such modifications and
 >     may provide (sublicense) additional or different license terms and
 >     conditions for use, reproduction, distribution or further
 >     modification of Your modifications, or for the Derivative Work as
 >     a whole, provided that the sublicense complies with the conditions
 >     stated in this License.

Q: an example of this would also be nice. I believe this says I may copy 
the apache license, change its name, add a few clauses about limiting 
distribution outside the US (for example), assume liability, call it the 
"Bla-Bla, Inc. Open Source License", and distribute ASF-created code 
under that license. Is that correct?

A: Nope. this says that you may add a copyright notice and additional 
license terms to the modified files, for example "This changed file 
copyright Leo Simons and licensed under the GPL". That does not mean you 
have the right to modify the Apache license itself. That's not necessary 
for this purpose. You can include your own license document and refer to 
the Apache license in there.



thanks for any corrections/additions!

Since it looks like the patent termination
clauses are going to be scaled back from the
proposed license, how do folks feel about 
extending the termination clause to cover 4a 
as well?  The advantage would be that this might 
also prevent unpatented contributions from being 
usurped into a closed-source derivative by a 
non-contributing patent holder.

Since the majority of ASF contributions are
likely to remain unpatented, this might be 
worth considering.

Thoughts?

That's not a "risk", that's a decision.  You don't have to use open
source software if you don't want.  If you decide to give up that
benefit, then you also have to give up the benefit of enforcing your
patents against open source developers.

That said, I agree with you that the term is badly worded and needs to
be changed.  It should say "any patent OR COPYRIGHT licenses".

The whole point of this term is to carve out a space whereby Apache
developers can write software without fear that they will be sued for
patent infringement.  Large companies like HP, IBM, and others,
who have a large patent portfolio, can use cross-licensing to protect
themselves from patent infringement threats.  Open source developers
typically don't file for patents -- their only resource is their
software.

You would have HP deny its resources (patents) to people who
threaten it.  Why do you say that the ASF should NOT deny its
resources (software) to people who threaten it?

In other thread, Brian points out that this creates a potential
quandry for a patent-holding Apache user.  If somebody wants to cause
them trouble, he can infringe their patent and contribute that code to
Apache.  I don't think that's the problem Brian thinks it is.  First,
they're an Apache user, so using that code helps them too.  Second,
they can implement a work-around and contribute it to Apache.  Third,
they can still enforce their patent against anybody who's using that
software outside of Apache.

Hi Scott,

Thank you for forwarding to me HP's official position on open source =
patent
defense provisions.

Here's what many of us have decided to say in our licenses: "You cannot =
use
my open source software if you sue me for patent infringement with =
respect
to a patent applicable to software." =20

For IBM, Apple, Nokia, Sun, Mozilla (Netscape) and many other large
companies, the ability to use their patents to defend themselves against
patent infringement lawsuits is central to their patent strategies.  And =
why
not so while this race to the patent office continues unabated?  Why =
should
companies be expected to grant free licenses to their intellectual =
property
if that IP will no longer be available for defensive purposes against =
other
big companies?  Unless they can retain the ability to use their patents =
for
defensive purposes, those large companies will grant many fewer patent
licenses -- and open source software will be the poorer.

You say that "there is no good way to manage that termination risk."  =
Just
as none of us can easily manage the risk that we will be sued for patent
infringement.  How else would you have us deal with that threat, =
especially
when it comes from our very own licensees and those who use our free
software?

You're correct on the narrow point that the patent termination provision =
in
Apache's proposed new license is of little value to the Apache Software
Foundation itself.  Since ASF owns no important patents and probably =
never
will, the right to terminate their patent licenses if they are sued for
patent infringement will never be exercised by them.  I assume that most =
of
Apache's individual contributors also own no patents and will not =
benefit
from that license's patent license termination.  I don't think the =
author of
the proposed Apache license really thought through that provision =
carefully,
but merely copied it from one of the other licenses you criticized.

That is another reason that the ASF should consider using the Academic =
Free
License, which *would* effectively protect Apache and its contributors.  =
It
terminates both patent and copyright licenses, rather than just patent
licenses, in the event of a claim of patent infringement "with respect =
to a
patent applicable to software." =20

I suppose that HP will like even less the Academic Free License (and the
almost identical Open Software License) because if you sue us for patent
infringement with respect to a patent applicable to software you will =
also
lose our *copyright* licenses.  But I see no reason to make the =
management
of that termination risk any easier for big patent holders like HP.  I =
want
you to think long and hard before you sue me for infringement of a =
software
patent.  You may win royalties and damages, but you'll no longer be able =
to
use my free software. =20

/Larry Rosen

P.S. Please consider how HP could benefit by energetically buying into =
this
open source form of license termination rather than treating it as a
business risk.  The more patents and copyrights HP contributes into =
valuable
open source software under such licenses, the more easily HP will be =
able to
defend itself from software patent infringement lawsuits by its =
competitors.

That would be mistaken.  I am willing to rely on our community of
contributors to act in our stead, since they do have patents and *their*
patent grants may be terminated in such a case.  That is why the
proposed 2.0 license is phrased as being from the Contributors.
If none of the Contributors have any applicable patents, then the
situation is no better and no worse than for the current license.
The ASF would have to cancel the project and/or ask for help to
invalidate the patent.

It is my understanding that such a clause would not be GPL-compatible,
though you'll have to ask Eben for a more authoritative reading.  The 
2.0
license is designed so that a recipient's right to copy and modify the
software remains equivalent to the GPL even if the patent license is
terminated.  I'm not sure if that will still be true with GPL 3, but we
can revisit that when needed.

If you want to solve the GPL compatibility problem cleanly, why not 
dual-license? Then, you can use Larry's form of termination. If anyone 
litigates against free software, the Apache 2.0 license terminates and 
they are left with the GPL as their only valid license. Then, if it 
happens that they had previously mixed proprietary software with Apache, 
or they depend on any such software, that gets poisoned.

    Thanks

Because with dual-licensed software it is impossible to know what
terms are being followed by any given contributor, short of an explicit
declaration on every contribution.

I'm not sure you understand my point, not least because you use "they" to
mean two different parties.  Let me try to make it even clearer.

Person X uses a lot of open-source software - he can't help it, it's
ubiquitous now.  Person X also owns Patent X.  Person Y writes commercial
software, one small feature of which would be covered by Patent X.
Person Y thus decides to release a small Library Y that implements Patent
X under a BSD license;  note that Person Y does NOT contribute Library Y
to Apache, they just release it on sf.net or something.  Person Y then
incorporates Library Y into their commercial application - thus avoiding
needing to pay Person X any patent fees.  Person X can't sue to seek
license fees, because to do so would destroy his business by forcing him
to stop using software with patent-mutual-defence licenses.  Furthermore,
anyone out there who wants to write code that would be covered by Patent X
decides to use Library Y to avoid paying Person X any patent fees.

To many of you, you're saying "so what? this sounds like a good thing."
I repeat my assertion: doing this requires Person X to make a choice
between using open-source software, and being able to enforce their
patents.  I fear that by requiring that choice we would be forcing many of
the companies who today pay the salaries of many of the developers of
Apache (and other projects) to decide to move their use and support to
other solutions that don't force that choice.

You could state, "well, just carve out the case where Library Y is being
used in a commercial application, or outside Apache, so that Person X can
still seek licensing fees in that case" - but that doesn't work well,
because you have to define "commercial" and "outside", and you'd have to
tell me whether my ASP that uses open source software counts as that, and
if it does, does your use of open source software as a business tool also
count.  Slippery slope.

Apache (and other projects) to decide to move their use and support to
other solutions that don't force that choice.

You could state, "well, just carve out the case where Library Y is being
used in a commercial application, or outside Apache, so that Person X can
still seek licensing fees in that case" - but that doesn't work well,
because you have to define "commercial" and "outside", and you'd have to
tell me whether my ASP that uses open source software counts as that, and
if it does, does your use of open source software as a business tool also
count.  Slippery slope.

I think you misunderstand, or I do.  The patent licenses that terminate
are the patent licenses from the contributors as they apply to
Apache-released software.  The primary patent-related goal in Apache is to
prevent a company from sneaking code into the codebase covered by their
own patent and then seeking royalties from either the ASF or end-users,
whatever purpose those end-users have, commercial or otherwise.

So long as everyone feels like having this very useful conversation,
I'd like to ask a couple of questions that I've been mulling over.
These are non-argumentative questions; I don't know what the "right"
patent defense policy for free software licenses is, and I'm still
trying to understand both the problem itself and the dynamic effects
of the various proposed measures of solution.

	1.  Why is it that we don't presently observe instances of the
            problem we are trying to solve?  Patent infringement
            lawsuits have not been brought against free software
            programs, though there are lots of software patents and a
            certain serious number of infringement actions.  Is the
            non-occurrence simply an artifact of probability, or are
            there existing social and legal mechanisms that already
            establish a gradient against such actions, a form of
            "natural immunity" which our licensing or other
            defense arrangements might act to strengthen?

	2.  If I am a patent-holder wishing to sue some part of the
            free software ecology for patent infringement, either in
            order to obtain license revenue or in order to disrupt the
            free software system, couldn't I build a separated special
            purpose entity that would hold the relevant patent(s) and
            conduct the litigation, thus insulating my main businesses
            from the retaliatory effect of license cancellations?

Best regards to all.

The reason is simple: patent litigation is *extremely* expensive
(expect over a million in fees and other costs). You simply Do Not
sue people for patent infringement if the value of the suit is
less than that. Most open source developers are not multi-million
dollar entities, and so you simply can't expect to recover your
costs.

This might change if a company wishes to stop a certain open source
project and happens to have a lot of cash sitting around. I don't
know of many such companies.

Another issue is the low visibility of open source amongst most
patent holders, together with a lack of awareness that open
source licenses have patent clauses. It's not trivial to see that 
the GPL has a mandatory RF patent license clause, for example.

Next, there's the large amount of negative publicity you will
get if you announce you will sue an open source project. 

But I still think the most important reason is that open source
simply isn't on the radar screens in most patent departments.
For most companies, this will not change until a big competitor
puts open source in their products which infringes on the
company's patents. Then the company will sue, upon which the
competitor will counter with "But you distributed that same
open source under GPL a year ago".

That's about the only scenario I can think of where patents
and open source will conflict. And it assumes the big competitor
will use open source for important technology, that the two
companies do not have a cross license, and so on.

You will want to keep control over the patent or the separate
business unit that will sue with it. Otherwise, how are you going
to ensure you get the benefits from the lawsuit back? 

And if you have effective control, it's not really a separate
entity anymore. 

Still, it might work in some cases. If one business unit uses
GPL-licensed software, that unit is the "You" in the license
and must stick to its terms. If the patents are owned by another
business unit (both under the umbrella of the mother company),
then the patent business unit is not bound by the GPL, because
the GPL does not have a clause that defines "You" to include
affiliated companies. Perhaps it should.

Perhaps I should state at this point I'm a patent attorney working
for a big company. The above is purely my own opinion of course.

I'll echo Arnaud by saying it is a combination of lacking a purse
that can be pilfered and the bad PR that would result.  However, I have
been informed that there have been situations in which large companies
using our software have been approached by patent-owning companies,
either for the sake of demanding fees for use of our software or as a
counter-claim for the purpose of cross-licensing.  It is therefore a
major concern for the companies who participate in our projects.

Typically that is handled by defining "You" or "Recipient" to the
same extent that I defined "Contributor" in the proposed license.

I feel that one of the most important reasons for this is strategic in 
nature. Some of the large software patent holding companies do not want 
to create bad news about software patenting before they have the 
legislation supporting them that they want in all industrially-important 
venues. Thus, I believe that the final approval of software patent 
legislation in the EU will be followed by a rash of software patent 
lawsuits.

Patent lawsuits against Open Source developers are not necessarily

have to settle early in the process.

There are more than enough companies in the world that would gain an 
advantage from bringing suit against us with intent to restrain, and 
with no expectation of significant damages. I think you'll see some of 
these after the current SCO nonsense is over. It's the only way to go 
after us with a solid legal foundation.

    Thanks

I'm sure there are. However those companies would not be 
depending on any open source for that "business", so they
couldn't care less about any patent language in open
source licenses.

In fact for the SCO kind of company such patent license
grants may be useful for more FUD: "Look everyone, open
source wants to take away all your patents".

Current European caselaw already supports the EPO's view that
software _is_ patentable. Keep in mind that failed directive
had as its stated purpose to write down the current state of
affairs, not to create patentability where there was none.

Right now software patents *are* being licensed and *are* being
enforced in Europe. It's just that they are only being licensed
to people with expensive products in large numbers, and that
does not create a lot of attention in the press. 

Take a look at the non-US patents on the MPEG-2 essential patent
list, and then ask yourself why all these European licensees
would be purchasing MPEG-2 licenses if software patents are illegal
in Europe.

Hi Eben,

Good questions.

1. I think we *are* beginning to observe instances of the problem we are
trying to solve.  The EOLAS patents, for example, were such a threat =
that
W3C formed a PAG that recommended reexamination (which the PTO just =
agreed
to do).  I've read emails from Bruce Perens identifying patents that =
have
affected IETF standards.  Perhaps others in cc have specific examples.  =
On
the other hand, what evidence can you adduce to suggest that there is =
some
form of "natural immunity" for open source software?

2. The escape hatch you describe can be prevented by appropriate license
language.  For example, many open source licenses define the licensee as
"any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with" licensee.  I've wondered if the EOLAS patent would be less a =
threat to
open source browsers if the University of California, a passive =
plaintiff in
that infringement lawsuit, were threatened with loss of its rights to =
open
source software.  If current language provisions like these aren't
sufficient, can you suggest more effective language?

Under the AFL, patents from licensor (contributors *or* distributors) =
are
licensed to all royalty-free.  [See =A7 2.]  Your scenario wouldn't =
happen if
you used the AFL as both your contributors' license and your =
distribution
license.  The AFL =A7 2 prevents anyone from "sneaking code into the =
codebase
covered by their own patent and then seeking royalties" for it.  Section =
2
of the AFL deals with the licensor's patents. =20

As for the AFL patent termination provision [=A7 10], it deals with a =
very
different situation, where a licensee claims patent infringement of his =
own
patent -- either his patent relating to any software [=A7 10(a)] or his =
patent
relating to the licensed software [=A7 10(b)].  Section 10 of the AFL =
deals
with the licensee's patents.

By the way, please don't refer to =A7 10 as a "mutual defense" =
provision.
Largely at HP's suggestion [thanks, Scott!] the new versions of the AFL =
&
OSL licenses don't use mutual defense language any more. =20

The discussion today is about a provision similar in form and effect to =
the
IBM (and Mozilla, and Apple, and Nokia, and etc.) patent termination
language.  My point -- and Scott's -- is that typical open source =
license
patent defense provisions that terminate only the licensor's patent =
grants
are useless to any licensor (project or contributor) that doesn't own =
any
patents.  The only meaningful threat is to terminate both the licensor's
patent licenses [the license grant in AFL =A7 2] as well as the =
licensor's
copyright licenses [the license grant in AFL =A7 1].  That is what AFL =
=A7 10
does, and what the proposed Apache license doesn't do.

Scott is correct in characterizing this as an important consideration =
for
licensees of open source software.  (Scott calls it a "risk" and Russ =
calls
it a "decision"; I agree with Russ.)  I happen to believe that our =
software
is worth more than the possible value a licensee might receive from
asserting a software patent against an open source licensor or =
contributor.

  1. I think we *are* beginning to observe instances of the problem we are
  trying to solve.  The EOLAS patents, for example, were such a threat that
  W3C formed a PAG that recommended reexamination (which the PTO just agreed
  to do).  I've read emails from Bruce Perens identifying patents that have
  affected IETF standards.  Perhaps others in cc have specific examples.  On
  the other hand, what evidence can you adduce to suggest that there is some
  form of "natural immunity" for open source software?
  
Well, yes but no, Larry.  Eolas sues not the developers or
distributors of Mozilla, but Microsoft, looking for the deepest
pocket, as one would expect from a traditional patent plaintiff
primarily concerned with recovering royalties.  The W3C behaves as you
and I want it to, and as we told our colleagues on the PPWG it would
have to begin behaving: affirmatively challenging patents that
threaten obstruction.  That the members who were skeptical of that
course of conduct when the Free World first raised the possibility in
the PPWG in November 2001 found themselves doing it less than two
years later is a sign of one part of the ecology's development: like
Dan Ravicher's Public Patent Foundation, the W3C activity
demonstrates, I believe, that one aspect of patent defense will be
organizational, based on non-profit legal advocacy rather than
market-based license-controlled activity.

But I'm not, as I said before, asking argumentative questions, and I
wasn't leading up to "adducing evidence."  I'm asking how to interpret
negative evidence: the non-occurrence of actions against free software.
In that context I think I hear you saying that it's an artifact: given
more time, such suits will begin to happen in reasonable profusion and
addressing them by license provision will be necessary.  I don't say
you're wrong, just that I'm not yet sure.

  2. The escape hatch you describe can be prevented by appropriate license
  language.  For example, many open source licenses define the licensee as
  "any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
  with" licensee.  I've wondered if the EOLAS patent would be less a threat to
  open source browsers if the University of California, a passive plaintiff in
  that infringement lawsuit, were threatened with loss of its rights to open
  source software.  If current language provisions like these aren't
  sufficient, can you suggest more effective language?
  
You may be right here too, but it might be more complicated.  I think
the way a litigant intending disruption would probably circumvent the
licenses would be to form a non-profit and assign the patents
charitably.  A party interested in royalties would either sell the
claims to a patent-reclamation investor like Eugene Lang, or create an
arms'-length investment vehicle.  In the first instance, which I think
concerns me most, I see no likelihood of convincing a judge that the
donor "controls" in any relevant sense the non-profit to which it
donated the claims.  In the investment-entity case, any one particular
free software licensor *might* be able to pierce the veil and show
that the original entity should be found to have forfeited its
copyright license under the patent retaliation clause, but the costs
of enforcement and the uncertainty of success would have been
multiplied substantially.  Only the wealthiest free software licensor
could afford that effort, thus making the mutual defense aspect of
such clauses much less valuable.  At any rate, that's the speculation
that concerns me.  Let's hear what other people think.

Best.
Eben
