Hello,

One of the things that has been drilled into me over 25+ years as a
software developer is the importance of keeping the correct copyright
years in the source code. In particular, I have repeatedly heard from
corporate lawyers that it is *very* important to keep the original
copyright year on each file, in addition to the years of subsequent
modification. The reasons have to do with demonstration of "prior art" in
intellectual property law and patent litigation.

The reason I am bringing this up here is because I am seeing committers
across numerous Jakarta projects ignoring this. The problem is spreading
as people start switching to the new 2.0 license, overwriting the old
license with the new one using scripts, and thus losing the original
copyright year.

Rather than try to correct this each time I see it, and wonder how many
places I'm not catching, I think it would be a good idea if a message was
sent to committers@ pointing out the importance of this. Unless all those
corporate lawyers are wrong and / or it doesn't matter to the ASF, that
is... ;-)

Thanks.

I personally don't see why a file with "Copyright 1999-2004" is going to
be materially more or less effective than having a CVS tree with time
stamps going that far back.  For the purposes of anyone trying to follow
the terms of the license, the most recent date is all that matters.

So I wouldn't worry too much about it, is my sense - others?

You are  disabled from saying `I  published that before  you did' when
faced  wiah a  suit by  somebody saying  that your  code  infringes on
theirs.

The most important record of publication of a document is the document
itself,  here  the source  code.   Remember  the  copyright /  version
histories somewhere in the first pages of a book?

Terms of license, yes. But when it comes to copyright ownerhship and
infringement claims, it is a different story.

Uh, but the artifact being published was published in 2004, not 1998.
Simply putting "1998" into the license does nothing to prove I actually
wrote any of that code in 1998, and it certainly doesn't mean all of it
was available in 1998.  If faced with such a suit, we'd reach back into
the CVS history and/or archive.org and/or our own release packages in our
archive to show what was published when.  Older releases don't suddenly
vanish when a newer release comes out.

This is somewhat academic until we've got cases decided in court to set a
precedent for what's an authoritative claim of date of authorship.  I know
that I'd rather go in to court with a URL to archive.org with a date
showing the release of Apache 0.9.1 in 1995 rather than the current code
showing "copyright 1995-2004".

Books aren't different in publishing their version history.  Most
software, commercial and open source, have changelogs or release notes
that detail what changes were made when.  But knowing when a specific
algorithm or snippet of code is best demonstrated by showing the CVS tree.

In fact, it might behoove us to make regular tape backups of the CVS tree
and submit them to a records firm like Iron Mountain, which can timestamp
them and store them in perpetuity in a way that is irrefutable.  I
understand some companies have done this with the copy of Linux they
downloaded from SCO under the GPL, just in case SCO's lawyers send them a
pay-up letter.

IANAL, TINLA, if it's convenient to keep the year ranges when updating the
license there's probably no harm in doing so.  But I don't see a need to
mandate it.  If others in the ASF disagree, please speak up, I don't want
to be the last word on this.

And nothing you put in the license can change that story.  :)

Hi,

this link http://opensource.org/licenses/apachepl.html points to a 
description of the Apache License 1.1.

Do we want opensource.org to publish a different article about the 
Apache License 2.0 ?

Or do we want them to upgrade this link ?

I am asking you this in the context of the Ant 1.6.1 release.

I did not announce this release on freshmeat yet because of the fact 
that they refer indirectly to the Apache License 1.1 only under 
http://freshmeat.net/faq/view/48/#833.



Cheers,

Antoine

That is coz. v. 1.1 license is approved by the OSI as a Open Source
License.

That  requires approval  of the  license by  the OSI  board.  Somebody
called  `Rodent of  Unusual Size  <Ken.Coar@Golux.Com>'  has submitted
v. 2.0 of  the license there, and so far, no  responses are there, for
or against approval.

Is this Ken.Coar@Golux.Com a contributor  to apache codebase or as his
name suggests err  ...  a rat?  Probably, the unsual  name is a reason
for people on the license discuss not commenting, but then it also may
be coz people have nothing *against* approval.

HTH.

Hi all,

     We were going over the new license and noticed something that
looked really kind of odd to us, in section 3 it says:

        [...] where such license applies only to those patent claims
        licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed
        by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
        Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
        submitted.

     The troubling part of this is the 'by combination of their
Contributions(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted.'  The question is does this apply retroactively?

     So taking the following example:

Company A contributes to project P.

Company B the contributes code that necessarily infringes Company A's
patents to project P.

     Now at this point Company A is now in the position of having
the "combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted" necessarily infringe it's patents.
Meaning in at least some reading of the Apache License that they must
grant a license for the patent.

     I hope this was not the intent as it means that any committer can
instantly gain a license for any patent, expressible in software, held
by another contributor. Simply contribute the infringing code, check
it out and then use that code in what ever product they want to.

     I suspect that there is an intention of limiting 'the Work' to
"the Work as it existed at the time the Contribution(s) was
submitted".

     So going back to the example above Company A would only
be granting the license if it contributed code _after_ Company B
contributed the infringing code, because the Work it submitted the
contribution to did not infringe it's patent, a "newer version" of the
Work does.

     Is there any chance of getting this clarified?

My reading of that phrase is only the patents embodied in the 
Contribution are licensed. The license permits combining the
Contribution with the Work, but does not require licensing of
patents in the (rest of the) Work.
